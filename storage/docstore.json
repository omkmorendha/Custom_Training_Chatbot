This is a tough ranking that he spent hours mulling over. Strawberries are a no-brainer. They're delicious, have low calories, and can be eaten by themselves or as a topping. Aashish prefers adding them to oatmeal and pancakes. The same goes for blueberries, though they don't taste as well, which is why they rank second. Apples have this sweet and yet tart flavor that you can never get bored of. He tends to eat them alone though. There are recipes that attempt to make dishes with apples (e.g., apple french toast), but they always end up reducing the flavor of the apple. Bananas are a staple. They're healthy and cheap, so Aashish always includes them in my pantry. They're also the easiest to incorporate into cooking, given that they work with many other flavors. Furthermore, when bananas blacken, they can still be used in many baking recipes. That being said, the taste of a banana itself doesn't rival strawberries, blueberries, or apples. So, they rank fourth. Finally, oranges are incredibly rich in flavor, ranging from sweet to sour. Aashish never gets tired of them. However, they're difficult to incorporate into dishes. He's seen oranges added to salads, but that, to him, is just blasphemous.

Kiyosaki\n \nINTRODUCTION\n  There is a Need\n  \nDoes school prepare children for the real world? \u201cStudy hard and get good grades and you will\nfind a high-paying job with great benefits,\u201d my parents used to say. Their goal in life was to\nprovide a college education for my older sister and me, so that we would have the greatest\nchance for success in life. When I finally earned my diploma in 1976-graduating with honors,\nand near the top of my class, in accounting from Florida State University-my parents had\nrealized their goal. It was the crowning achievement of their lives. In accordance with the\n\u201cMaster Plan,\u201d I was hired by a \u201cBig 8\u201d accounting firm, and I looked forward to a long career\nand retirement at an early age.\n  \nMy husband, Michael, followed a similar path. We both came from hardworking families, of\nmodest means but with strong work ethics. Michael also graduated with honors, but he did it\ntwice: first as an engineer and then from law school. He was quickly recruited by a prestigious\nWashington, D.C., law firm that specialized in patent law, and his future seemed bright, career\npath well-defined and early retirement guaranteed.\n  \nAlthough we have been successful in our careers, they have not turned out quite as we\nexpected. We both have changed positions several times-for all the right reasons-but there are\nno pension plans vesting on our behalf. Our retirement funds are growing only through our\nindividual contributions.\n  \nMichael and I have a wonderful marriage with three great children. As I write this, two are in\ncollege and one is just beginning high school. We have spent a fortune making sure our children\nhave received the best education available.\n  \nOne day in 1996, one of my children came home disillusioned with school. He was bored and\ntired of studying. \u201cWhy should I put time into studying subjects I will never use in real life?\u201d he\nprotested.\n  \nWithout thinking, I responded, \u201cBecause if you don't get good grades, you won't get into\ncollege.\u201d \u201cRegardless of whether I go to college,\u201d he replied, \u201cI'm going to be rich.\u201d\n  \n\u201cIf you don't graduate from college, you won't get a good job,\u201d I responded with a tinge of panic\nand motherly concern. \u201cAnd if you don't have a good job, how do you plan to get rich?\u201d\n  \nMy son smirked and slowly shook his head with mild boredom. We have had this talk many\ntimes before. He lowered his head and rolled his eyes. My words of motherly wisdom were\nfalling on deaf ears once again.\n  \nThough smart and strong-willed, he has always been a polite and respectful young man.\n  \n\u201cMom,\u201d he began. It was my turn to be lectured. \u201cGet with the times! Look around; the richest\npeople didn't get rich because of their educations. Look at Michael Jordan and Madonna. Even\nBill Gates, who dropped out of Harvard, founded Microsoft; he is now the richest man in\nPage 2/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2898, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0021d5ce-9ceb-441d-ba3b-23ea127e604e": {"__data__": {"id_": "0021d5ce-9ceb-441d-ba3b-23ea127e604e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8daa040a-eb66-4ed4-aec5-44b162bde8b3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "9b68d0c748d4e9dd5fbb761b9980f248adaeba26eea29409c20d22ab4d9202eb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1df58197-c87d-4e85-a760-e47642ee6122", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "2c437785c7657475055e5e06f81a8538dd1140b5fe5467fc014fe76867d926a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fd67df4d-d938-40f4-916b-fc17ff96667f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3494f52090cdc62ca79d6bb1c3313c060a7af35f2033616c67ac856d975e34d9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "79ee952d13c09d1da4e2d41d82acab19b0144e8a23fc5a342d6a3211d8a71e6b", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T.

There is a baseball pitcher who makes more than $4 million a\nyear even though he has been labeled `mentally challenged.' \u201d\n  \nThere was a long silence between us. It was dawning on me that I was giving my son the same\nadvice my parents had given me. The world around us has changed, but the advice hasn't.\n  \nGetting a good education and making good grades no longer ensures success, and nobody\nseems to have noticed, except our children.\n  \n\u201cMom,\u201d he continued, \u201cI don't want to work as hard as you and dad do. You make a lot of\nmoney, and we live in a huge house with lots of toys. If I follow your advice, I'll wind up like you,\nworking harder and harder only to pay more taxes and wind up in debt. There is no job security\nanymore; I know all about downsizing and rightsizing. I also know that college graduates today\nearn less than you did when you graduated. Look at doctors. They don't make nearly as much\nmoney as they used to. I know I can't rely on Social Security or company pensions for\nretirement. I need new answers.\u201d\n  \nHe was right. He needed new answers, and so did I. My parents' advice may have worked for\npeople born before 1945, but it may be disastrous for those of us born into a rapidly changing\nworld. No longer can I simply say to my children,\n  \n\u201cGo to school, get good grades, and look for a safe, secure job.\u201d\n  \nI knew I had to look for new ways to guide my children's education.\n  \nAs a mother as well as an accountant, I have been concerned by the lack of financial education\nour children receive in school. Many of today's youth have credit cards before they leave high\nschool, yet they have never had a course in money or how to invest it, let alone understand how\ncompound interest works on credit cards. Simply put, without financial literacy and the\nknowledge of how money works, they are not prepared to face the world that awaits them, a\nworld in which spending is emphasized over savings.\n  \nWhen my oldest son became hopelessly in debt with his credit cards as a freshman in college, I\nnot only helped him destroy the credit cards, but I also went in search of a program that would\nhelp me educate my children on financial matters.\n  \nOne day last year, my husband called me from his office. \u201cI have someone I think you should\nmeet,\u201d he said. \u201cHis name is Robert Kiyosaki. He's a businessman and investor, and he is here\napplying for a patent on an educational product. I think it's what you have been looking for.\u201d\n  \nJust What I Was Looking For\n  \nMy husband, Mike, was so impressed with CASHFLOW, the new educational product that\nRobert Kiyosaki was developing, that he arranged for both of us to participate in a test of the\nprototype. Because it was an educational game, I also asked my 19-year-old daughter, who was\na freshman at a local university, if she would like to take part, and she agreed.\n  \nAbout fifteen people, broken into three groups, participated in the test.\n  \nMike was right. It was the educational product I had been looking for. But it had a twist: It\nPage 3/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3122, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd67df4d-d938-40f4-916b-fc17ff96667f": {"__data__": {"id_": "fd67df4d-d938-40f4-916b-fc17ff96667f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3e0b015c-06bb-4471-ad74-32fa440e61c8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "033ff05a84c6a9d4f27b68c283a6bb7143bed730117b79d245df689ef5d3e7d5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0021d5ce-9ceb-441d-ba3b-23ea127e604e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "79ee952d13c09d1da4e2d41d82acab19b0144e8a23fc5a342d6a3211d8a71e6b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c562beac-3863-4dad-b9a2-251e2d7b7d14", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e265db3adaf804ddc71963caaa3c18970fe8d1a389a4dcade983dd915519ed45", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "3494f52090cdc62ca79d6bb1c3313c060a7af35f2033616c67ac856d975e34d9", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T.

The object of the game\nwas to get out of the inside track-what Robert called the \u201cRat Race\u201d and reach the outer track,\nor the \u201cFast Track.\u201d As Robert put it, the Fast Track simulates how rich people play in real life.\n  \nRobert then defined the \u201cRat Race\u201d for us.\n  \n\"If you look at the life of the average-educated, hard-working person, there is a similar path. The\nchild is born and goes to school. The proud parents are excited because the child excels, gets\nfair to good grades, and is accepted into a college. The child graduates, maybe goes on to\ngraduate school and then does exactly as programmed: looks for a safe, secure job or career.\nThe child finds that job, maybe as a doctor or a lawyer, or joins the Army or works for the\ngovernment. Generally, the child begins to make money, credit cards start to arrive in mass, and\nthe shopping begins, if it already hasn't.\n  \n\"Having money to burn, the child goes to places where other young people just like them hang\nout, and they meet people, they date, and sometimes they get married. Life is wonderful now,\nbecause today, both men and women work. Two incomes are bliss. They feel successful, their\nfuture is bright, and they decide to buy a house, a car, a television, take vacations and have\nchildren. The happy bundle arrives. The demand for cash is enormous. The happy couple\ndecides that their careers are vitally important and begin to work harder, seeking promotions\nand raises. The raises come, and so does another child and the need for a bigger house. They\nwork harder, become better employees, even more dedicated. They go back to school to get\nmore specialized skills so they can earn more money. Maybe they take a second job. Their\nincomes go up, but so does the tax bracket they're in and the real estate taxes on their new\nlarge home, and their Social Security taxes, and all the other taxes. They get their large\npaycheck and wonder where all the money went. They buy some mutual funds and buy\ngroceries with their credit card. The children reach 5 or 6 years of age, and the need to save for\ncollege increases as well as the need to save for their retirement. .\n  \n\"That happy couple, born 35 years ago, is now trapped in the Rat Race for the rest of their\nworking days. They work for the owners of their company, for the government paying taxes,\nand for the bank paying off a mortgage and credit cards.\n  \n\u201cThen, they advise their own children to `study hard, get good grades, and find a safe job or\ncareer.' They learn nothing about money, except from those who profit from their na\u00efvet\u00e9, and\nwork hard all their lives. The process repeats into another hard-working generation. This is the\n`Rat Race'.\u201d\n  \nThe only way to get out of the \u201cRat Race\u201d is to prove your proficiency at both accounting and\ninvesting, arguably two of the most difficult subjects to master. As a trained CPA who once\nworked for a Big 8 accounting firm, I was surprised that Robert had made the learning of these\ntwo subjects both fun and exciting. The process was so well disguised that while we were\ndiligently working to get out of the \u201cRat Race,\u201d we quickly forgot we were learning.\n  \nSoon a product test turned into a fun afternoon with my daughter, talking about things we had\nnever discussed before. As an accountant, playing a game that required an Income Statement\nand Balance Sheet was easy.

What greatly\ndisturbed me was how little these people knew about either accounting or investing, subjects so\nimportant in their lives. I wondered how they managed their own financial affairs in real life. I\ncould understand why my 19-year-old daughter would not understand, but these were grown\nadults, at least twice her age.\n  \nAfter I was out of the \u201cRat Race,\u201d for the next two hours I watched my daughter and these\neducated, affluent adults roll the dice and move their markers. Although I was glad they were all\nlearning so much, I was disturbed by how much the adults did not know about the basics of\nsimple accounting and investing. They had difficulty grasping the relationship between their\nIncome Statement and their Balance Sheet. As they bought and sold assets, they had trouble\nremembering that each transaction could impact their monthly cash flow. I thought, how many\nmillions of people are out there in the real world struggling financially, only because they have\nnever been taught these subjects?\n  \nThank goodness they're having fun and are distracted by the desire to win the game, I said to\nmyself. After Robert ended the contest, he allowed us fifteen minutes to discuss and critique\nCASHFLOW among ourselves.\n  \nThe business owner at my table was not happy. He did not like the game. \u201cI don't need to know\nthis,\u201d he said out loud. \u201cI hire accountants, bankers and attorneys to tell me about this stuff.\u201d\n  \nTo which Robert replied, \u201cHave you ever noticed that there are a lot of accountants who aren't\nrich? And bankers, and attorneys, and stockbrokers and real estate brokers. They know a lot,\nand for the most part are smart people, but most of them are not rich. Since our schools do not\nteach people what the rich know, we take advice from these people. But one day, you're\ndriving down the highway, stuck in traffic, struggling to get to work, and you look over to your\nright and you see your accountant stuck in the same traffic jam. You look to your left and you\nsee your banker. That should tell you something.\u201d\n  \nThe computer programmer was also unimpressed by the game: \u201cI can buy software to teach me\nthis.\u201d\n  \nThe banker, however, was moved. \u201cI studied this in school-the accounting part, that is-but I\nnever knew how to apply it to real life. Now I know. I need to get myself out of the `Rat Race.' \u201d\n  \nBut it was my daughter's comments that most touched me. \u201cI had fun learning,\u201d she said. \u201cI\nlearned a lot about how money really works and how to invest.\u201d\n  \nThen she added: \u201cNow I know I can choose a profession for the work I want to perform and not\nbecause of job security, benefits or howmuch I get paid. If I learn what this game teaches, I'm\nfree to do and study what my heart wants to study. . .rather than study something because\nbusinesses are looking for certain job skills. If I learn this, I won't have to worry about job\nsecurity and Social Security the way most of my classmates already do.\u201d\n  \nPage 5/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3320, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f3ca9390-1cc2-403a-8cc3-c338631dfeb7": {"__data__": {"id_": "f3ca9390-1cc2-403a-8cc3-c338631dfeb7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f7429c6c-f470-4483-9f01-0fef41e21830", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "dcea21d30c63fc6fbbc3a2cec37cf8f8349cc165e0a5559c26ff1617bf26a66d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c562beac-3863-4dad-b9a2-251e2d7b7d14", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "e265db3adaf804ddc71963caaa3c18970fe8d1a389a4dcade983dd915519ed45", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e05d5cc0-5244-4104-bae6-a2f98b173b0d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "213d15797e6c9f704cfeea060074bded5fc6b6cc032e83241c01411a99cc1552", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "f9fff4c268565a8b45ac8ff4e85a55ca1c96b6773a0216832c520416462ac49a", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T. Kiyosaki\nI was not able to stay and talk with Robert after we had played the game, but we agreed to meet\nlater to further discuss his project. I knew he wanted to use the game to help others become\nmore financially savvy, and I was eager to hear more about his plans.\n  \nMy husband and I set up a dinner meeting with Robert and his wife within the next week.\nAlthough it was our first social get-together, we felt as if we had known each other for years.\n  \nWe found out we had a lot in common. We covered the gamut, from sports and plays to\nrestaurants and socio-economic issues. We talked about the changing world. We spent a lot of\ntime discussing how most Americans have little or nothing saved for retirement, as well as the\nalmost bankrupt state of Social Security and Medicare. Would my children be required to pay for\nthe retirement of 75 million baby boomers? We wondered if people realize how risky it is to\ndepend on a pension plan.\n  \nRobert's primary concern was the growing gap between the haves and have nots, in America\nand around the world. A self-taught, self-made entrepreneur who traveled the world putting\ninvestments together, Robert was able to retire at the age of 47. He came out of retirement\nbecause he shares the same concern I have for my own children. He knows that the world has\nchanged, but education has not changed with it. According to Robert, children spend years in an\nantiquated educational system, studying subjects they will never use, preparing for a world that\nno longer exists.\n  \n\u201cToday, the most dangerous advice you can give a child is `Go to school, get good grades and\nlook for a safe secure job,' \u201d he likes to say. \u201cThat is old advice, and it's bad advice. If you could\nsee what is happening in Asia, Europe, South America, you would be as concerned as I am.\u201d\n  \nIt's bad advice, he believes, \u201cbecause if you want your child to have a financially secure future,\nthey can't play by the old set of rules. It's just too risky.\u201d\n  \nI asked him what he meant by \u201cold rules?\u201d .\n  \n\u201cPeople like me play by a different set of rules from what you play by,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat happens\nwhen a corporation announces a downsizing?\u201d\n  \n\u201cPeople get laid off,\u201d I said. \"Families are hurt. Unemployment goes\n  \nup.\"\n  \n\u201cYes, but what happens to the company, in particular a public company on the stock\nexchange?\u201d\n  \n\u201cThe price of the stock usually goes up when the downsizing is announced,\u201d I said. \u201cThe market\nlikes it when a company reduces its labor costs, either through automation or just consolidating\nthe labor force in general.\u201d\n  \n\u201cThat's right,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when stock prices go up, people like me, the shareholders, get\nricher. That is what I mean by a different set of rules. Employees lose; owners and investors\nwin.\u201d\n  \nRobert was describing not only the difference between an employee and employer, but also the\nPage 6/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2916, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e05d5cc0-5244-4104-bae6-a2f98b173b0d": {"__data__": {"id_": "e05d5cc0-5244-4104-bae6-a2f98b173b0d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d9385227-55e0-493b-944e-d5a1fb7b29ed", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "2e1eaa91be424dd757d48fbbd3f55c0d58a80a324192b679d2fcd2dfa398b82e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f3ca9390-1cc2-403a-8cc3-c338631dfeb7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "f9fff4c268565a8b45ac8ff4e85a55ca1c96b6773a0216832c520416462ac49a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "56bd43ca-bc64-4b7c-8e0f-e76e222a4145", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6be826c8a8f4391e746c315b55339e4c5c8ee76a2834bae68a2e6b61188a4147", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "213d15797e6c9f704cfeea060074bded5fc6b6cc032e83241c01411a99cc1552", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T.

Each child needs more education. Different education. And they\nneed to know the rules. The different sets of rules.\u201d\n  \n\u201cThere are rules of money that the rich play by, and there are the rules that the other 95\npercent of the population plays by,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the 95 percent learns those rules at home\nand in school. That is why it's risky today to simply say to a child, `Study hard and look for a job.'\nA child today needs a more sophisticated education, and the current system is not delivering the\ngoods. I don't care how many computers they put in the classroom or how much money schools\nspend. How can the education system teach a subject that it does not know?\u201d\n  \nSo how does a parent teach their children, what the school does not? How do you teach\naccounting to a child? Won't they get bored? And how do you teach investing when as a parent\nyou yourself are risk averse? Instead of teaching my children to simply play it safe, I decided it\nwas best to teach them to play it smart.\n  \n\u201cSo how would you teach a child about money and all the things we've talked about?\u201d I asked\nRobert. \u201cHow can we make it easy for parents especially when they don't understand it\nthemselves?\u201d\n  \n\u201cI wrote a book on the subject, \u201d he said.\n  \n\u201cWhere is it?\u201d\n  \n\u201cIn my computer. It's been there for years in random pieces. I add to it occasionally but I've\nnever gotten around to put it all together. I began writing it after my other book became a best\nseller, but I never finished the new one. It's in pieces.\u201d\n  \nAnd in pieces it was. After reading the scattered sections, I decided the book had merit and\nneeded to be shared, especially in these changing times. We agreed to co-author Robert's book.\n  \nI asked him how much financial information he thought a child needed. He said it would depend\non the child. He knew at a young age that he wanted to be rich and was fortunate enough to\nhave a father figure who was rich and willing to guide him. Education is the foundation of\nsuccess, Robert said. Just as scholastic skills are vitally important, so are financial skills and\ncommunication skills.\n  \nWhat follows is the story of Robert's two dads, a rich one and a poor\n  \none, that expounds on the skills he's developed over a lifetime. The contrast between two dads\nprovides an important perspective. The book is supported, edited and assembled by me. For\nany accountants who read this book, suspend your academic book knowledge and open your\nmind to the theories Robert presents. Although many of them challenge the very fundamentals\nof generally accepted accounting principles, they provide a valuable insight into the way true\nPage 7/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3132, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56bd43ca-bc64-4b7c-8e0f-e76e222a4145": {"__data__": {"id_": "56bd43ca-bc64-4b7c-8e0f-e76e222a4145", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a7ca33f9-8c9d-4743-8f36-a7ae3dbf94f0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "95b0f1f824a2aa4801b298e61aabb09eeb49602311f0a06e04656b9212cf20e3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e05d5cc0-5244-4104-bae6-a2f98b173b0d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "213d15797e6c9f704cfeea060074bded5fc6b6cc032e83241c01411a99cc1552", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fbaf0693-14d4-4d45-b6ea-a00941c8e43d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d7cbfa6229b1c508c6fd07fadfa74763f08fdac9dcf9cc06cd5f234d399dca40", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "6be826c8a8f4391e746c315b55339e4c5c8ee76a2834bae68a2e6b61188a4147", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T.

It has always been the right thing to do. When I met Robert,\nhis ideas initially startled me. Having been raised by two fathers, he had been taught to strive for\ntwo different goals. His educated dad advised him to work for a corporation. His rich dad\nadvised him to own the corporation. Both life paths required education, but the subjects of study\nwere completely different. His educated dad encouraged Robert to be a smart person. His rich\ndad encouraged Robert to know how to hire smart people.\n  \nHaving two dads caused many problems. Robert's real dad was the superintendent of education\nfor the state of Hawaii. By the time Robert was 16, the threat of \u201cIf you don't get good grades,\nyou won't get a good job\u201d had little effect. He already knew his career path was to own\ncorporations, not to work for them. In fact, if it had not been for a wise and persistent high\nschool guidance counselor, Robert might not have gone on to college. He admits that. He was\neager to start building his assets, but finally agreed that the college education would also be a\nbenefit to him.\n  \nTruthfully, the ideas in this book are probably too far fetched and radical for most parents today.\nSome parents are having a hard enough time simply keeping their children in school. But in\nlight of our changing times, as parents we need to be open to new and bold ideas. To\nencourage children to be employees is to advise your children to pay more than their fair share\nof taxes over a lifetime, with little or no promise of a pension. And it is true that taxes are a\nperson's greatest expense. In fact, most families work from January to mid-May for the\ngovernment just to cover their taxes. New ideas are needed and this book provides them.\n  \nRobert claims that the rich teach their children differently. They teach their children at home,\naround the dinner table. These ideas may notbe the ideas you choose to discuss with your\nchildren, but thank you for looking at them. And I advise you to keep searching. In my opinion,\nas a mom and a CPA, the concept of simply getting good grades and finding a good job is an old\nidea. We need to advise our children with a greater degree of sophistication. We need new\nideas and different education. Maybe telling our children to strive to be good employees while\nalso striving to own their own investment corporation is not such a bad idea.\n  \nIt is my hope as a mother that this book helps other parents. It is Robert's hope to inform\npeople that anyone can achieve prosperity if they choose so. If today you are a gardener or a\njanitor or even unemployed, you have the ability to educate yourself and teach those you love to\ntake care of themselves financially. Remember that financial intelligence is the mental process\nvia which we solve our financial problems.\n  \nToday we are facing global and technological changes as great or even greater than those ever\nfaced before.

Kiyosaki\n \nCHAPTER ONE\n  Rich Dad, Poor Dad\n  \nAs narrated by Robert Kiyosaki\n  \nI had two fathers, a rich one and a poor one. One was highly educated and intelligent; he had a\nPh.D. and completed four years of undergraduate work in less than two years. He then went on\nto Stanford University, the University of Chicago, and Northwestern University to do his\nadvanced studies, all on full financial scholarships. The other father never finished the eighth\ngrade.\n  \nBoth men were successful in their careers, working hard all their lives. Both earned substantial\nincomes. Yet one struggled financially all his life. The other would become one of the richest\nmen in Hawaii. One died leaving tens of millions of dollars to his family, charities and his church.\nThe other left bills to be paid.\n  \nBoth men were strong, charismatic and influential. Both men offered me advice, but they did\nnot advise the same things. Both men believed strongly in education but did not recommend the\nsame course of study.\n  \nIf I had had only one dad, I would have had to accept or reject his advice. Having two dads\nadvising me offered me the choice of contrasting points of view; one of a rich man and one of a\npoor man.\n  \nInstead of simply accepting or rejecting one or the other, I found myself thinking more,\ncomparing and then choosing for myself.\n  \nThe problem was, the rich man was not rich yet and the poor man not yet poor. Both were just\nstarting out on their careers, and both were struggling with money and families. But they had\nvery different points of view about the subject of money.\n  \nFor example, one dad would say, \u201cThe love of money is the root of all evil.\u201d The other, \u201cThe\nlack of money is the root of all evil.\u201d\n  \nAs a young boy, having two strong fathers both influencing me was difficult. I wanted to be a\ngood son and listen, but the two fathers did not say the same things. The contrast in their points\nof view, particularly where money was concerned, was so extreme that I grew curious and\nintrigued. I began to start thinking for long periods of time about what each was saying.\n  \nMuch of my private time was spent reflecting, asking myself questions such as, \u201cWhy does he\nsay that?\u201d and then asking the same question of the other dad's statement. It would have been\nmuch easier to simply say, \u201cYeah, he's right. I agree with that.\u201d Or to simply reject the point of\nview by saying, \u201cThe old man doesn't know what he's talking about.\u201d Instead, having two dads\nwhom I loved forced me to think and ultimately choose a way of thinking for myself. As a\nprocess, choosing for myself turned out to be much more valuable in the long run, rather than\nsimply accepting or rejecting a single point of view.\nPage 10/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2771, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "61abf29f-6152-493c-9fd3-60c88f97d3fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "61abf29f-6152-493c-9fd3-60c88f97d3fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c432e7ae-aac8-4d52-9cd8-45e3e59308d3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "6a7562a3ebec4c19aeb618d8fe0f04a3aa2ff38188dfc930ce54f7634b23c28c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "90786ffb-6089-4b3e-b59d-1d725fb34cc0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "5338195195bd70cda445426ece6e7d324f2f785c75b5a57adf33409809a3b69d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f74d2ed8-9eee-4267-93ee-f88cd7df21a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0506debde857eff19b8861ad05a99a293d85be996114f0f2e14a7e99c31e8782", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "c59fcfdfcb88ce5229b176094617532c472f76211d1feb456c1b5a79bd677c74", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T. Kiyosaki\n  \nOne of the reasons the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and the middle class struggles in\ndebt is because the subject of money is taught at home, not in school. Most of us learn about\nmoney from our parents. So what can a poor parent tell their child about money? They simply\nsay \u201cStay in school and study hard.\u201d The child may graduate with excellent grades but with a\npoor person's financial programming and mind-set. It was learned while the child was young.\n  \nMoney is not taught in schools. Schools focus on scholastic and professional skills, but not on\nfinancial skills. This explains how smart bankers, doctors and accountants who earned excellent\ngrades in school may still struggle financially all of their lives. Our staggering national debt is due\nin large part to highly educated politicians and government officials making financial decisions\nwith little or no training on the subject of money.\n  \nI often look ahead to the new millennium and wonder what will happen when we have millions\nof people who will need financial and medical assistance. They will be dependent on their\nfamilies or the government for financial support. What will happen when Medicare and Social\nSecurity run out of money? How will a nation survive if teaching children about money continues\nto be left to parents-most of whom will be, or already are, poor?\n  \nBecause I had two influential fathers, I learned from both of them. I had to think about each\ndad's advice, and in doing so, I gained valuable insight into the power and effect of one's\nthoughts on one's life. For example, one dad had a habit of saying, \u201cI can't afford it.\u201d The other\ndad forbade those words to be used. He insisted I say, \u201cHow can I afford it?\u201d One is a\nstatement, and the other is a question. One lets you off the hook, and the other forces you to\nthink. My soon-to-be-rich dad would explain that by automatically saying the words \u201cI can't\nafford it,\u201d your brain stops working. By asking the question \u201cHow can I afford it?\u201d your brain is\nput to work. He did not mean buy everything you wanted. He was fanatical about exercising\nyour mind, the most powerful computer in the world. \u201cMy brain gets stronger every day because\nI exercise it. The stronger it gets, the more money I can make.\u201d He believed that automatically\nsaying \u201cI can't afford it\u201d was a sign of mental laziness.\n  \nAlthough both dads worked hard, I noticed that one dad had a habit of putting his brain to sleep\nwhen it came to money matters, and the other had a habit of exercising his brain. The long-\nterm result was that one dad grew stronger financially and the other grew weaker. It is not much\ndifferent from a person who goes to the gym to exercise on a regular basis versus someone who\nsits on the couch watching television. Proper physical exercise increases your chances for\nhealth, and proper mental exercise increases your chances for wealth. Laziness decreases both\nhealth and wealth.\n  \nMy two dads had opposing attitudes in thought. One dad thought that the rich should pay more\nin taxes to take care of those less fortunate. The other said, \u201cTaxes punish those who produce\nand reward those who don't produce.\u201d\n  \nOne dad recommended, \u201cStudy hard so you can find a good company to work for.\u201d The other\nrecommended, \u201cStudy hard so you can find a good company to buy.\u201d One dad said, \u201cThe\nreason I'm not rich is because I have you kids.\u201d The other said, \u201cThe reason I must be rich is\nbecause I have you kids.\u201d One encouraged talking about money and business at the dinner table.\nThe other forbade the subject of money to be discussed over a meal. One said, \u201cWhen it comes\nPage 11/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3694, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f74d2ed8-9eee-4267-93ee-f88cd7df21a6": {"__data__": {"id_": "f74d2ed8-9eee-4267-93ee-f88cd7df21a6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bae0939c-2426-499b-9c0a-71cc90dadcff", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "31921de092208f1fe4fe9bb04998b4297630ae4999ccf72f374b88c0e3648d67", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "61abf29f-6152-493c-9fd3-60c88f97d3fd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "c59fcfdfcb88ce5229b176094617532c472f76211d1feb456c1b5a79bd677c74", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "43a7f672-efa4-49df-bdb8-b107611cde01", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "81cf078ee13af4afed316c0bb3ed09e14445626179a71ff9186d0b55e662538c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "0506debde857eff19b8861ad05a99a293d85be996114f0f2e14a7e99c31e8782", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T.

He was\nalways concerned about pay raises, retirement plans, medical benefits, sick leave, vacation days\nand other perks. He was impressed with two of his uncles who joined the military and earned a\nretirement and entitlement package for life after twenty years of active service. He loved the\nidea of medical benefits and PX privileges the military provided its retirees. He also loved the\ntenure system available through the university. The idea of job protection for life and job\nbenefits seemed more important, at times, than the job. He would often say, \u201cI've worked hard\nfor the government, and I'm entitled to these benefits.\u201d\n  \nThe other believed in total financial self-reliance. He spoke out against the \u201centitlement\u201d\nmentality and how it was creating weak and financially needy people. He was emphatic about\nbeing financially competent.\n  \nOne dad struggled to save a few dollars. The other simply created investments.\n  \nOne dad taught me how to write an impressive resume so I could find a good job. The other\ntaught me how to write strong business and financial plans so I could create jobs.\n  \nBeing a product of two strong dads allowed me the luxury of observing the effects different\nthoughts have on one's life. I noticed that people really do shape their life through their\nthoughts.\n  \nFor example, my poor dad always said, \u201cI'll never be rich.\u201d And that prophesy became reality.\nMy rich dad, on the other hand, always referred to himself as rich. He would say things like,\n\u201cI'm a rich man, and rich people don't do this.\u201d Even when he was flat broke after a major\nfinancial setback, he continued to refer to himself as a rich man. He would cover himself by\nsaying, \u201cThere is a difference between being poor and being broke. - Broke is temporary, and\npoor is eternal.\u201d\n  \nMy poor dad would also say, \u201cI'm not interested in money,\u201d or \u201cMoney doesn't matter.\u201d My rich\ndad always said, \u201cMoney is power.\u201d\n  \nThe power of our thoughts may never be measured or appreciated, but it became obvious to me\nas a young boy to be aware of my thoughts and how I expressed myself. I noticed that my poor\ndad was poor not because of the amount of money he earned, which was significant, but\nbecause of his thoughts and actions. As a young boy, having two fathers, I became acutely\naware of being careful which thoughts I chose to adopt as my own.

Kiyosaki\nrich, to understand how money works and to learn how to have it work for me. \u201cI don't work for\nmoney!\u201d were words he would repeat over and over, \u201cMoney works for me!\u201d\n  \nAt the age of 9, I decided to listen to and learn from my rich dad about money. In doing so, I\nchose not to listen to my poor dad, even though he was the one with all the college degrees.\n  \nA Lesson From Robert Frost\n  \nRobert Frost is my favourite poet. Although I love many of his poems, my favorite is The Road\nNot Taken. I use its lesson almost daily:\n  \nThe Road Not Taken\n  \nTwo roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both. And be one traveler,\nlong I stood. And looked down one as far as I could. To where it bent in the undergrowth;\n  \nThen took the other, as just as fair. And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy\nand wanted wear. Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same,\n  \nAnd both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for\nanother day! Yet knowing how way leads onto way, I doubted if I should ever come back.\n  \nI shall be telling this with a sigh. Somewhere ages and ages hence; Two roads diverged in a\nwood, and I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.\n  \nRobert Frost(1916)\n  \nAnd that made all the difference.\n  \nOver the years, I have often reflected upon Robert Frost's poem. Choosing not to listen to my\nhighly educated dad's advice and attitude about money was a painful decision, but it was a\ndecision that shaped the rest of my life.\n  \nOnce I made up my mind whom to listen to, my education about money began. My rich dad\ntaught me over a period of 30 years, until I was age 39. He stopped once he realized that I\nknew and fully understood what he had been trying to drum into my often thick skull.\n  \nMoney is one form of power. But what is more powerful is financial education. Money comes\nand goes, but if you have the education about how money works, you gain power over it and\ncan begin building wealth. The reason positive thinking alone does not work is because most\npeople went to school and never learned how money works, so they spend their lives working\nfor money.\n  \nBecause I was only 9 years old when I started, the lessons my rich dad taught me were simple.\nAnd when it was all said and done, there were only six main lessons, repeated over 30 years.\nThis book is about those six lessons, put as simply as possible as my rich dad put forth those\nlessons to me. The lessons are not meant to be answers but guideposts. Guideposts that will\nassist you and your children to grow wealthier no matter what happens in a world of increasing\nchange and uncertainty.\n  \nLesson #1 The Rich Don't Work for Money\n  \nPage 13/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2830, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8e478be-90c1-4ea1-b353-d6aee97d5528": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8e478be-90c1-4ea1-b353-d6aee97d5528", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "caf7083b-c51b-4f09-9540-6ca2defa9b5f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "521d43c0f4bc39cd52c7f320c8bb3f8204acfbb8507392efa7971723f67e2aec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "43a7f672-efa4-49df-bdb8-b107611cde01", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "81cf078ee13af4afed316c0bb3ed09e14445626179a71ff9186d0b55e662538c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "82e2a54d-9dee-490b-92cf-58878c429f9a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4590d6279f0b7632417c5f8b792540193a4849fd5d427f2ddb6f47b87f999f6b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "de6f1178117c8032384c1867607ff18e32ed582e4d69f535a61f195a0d8c984a", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T.

He took three of his friends, but Mike and I weren't invited. They\ntold us we weren't invited because we were `poor kids'.\u201d\n  \n\u201cThey did?\u201d my dad asked incredulously.\n  \n\u201cYeah, they did.\u201d I replied in a hurt tone.\n  \nMy dad silently shook his head, pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose and went back to\nreading the paper. I stood waiting for an answer.\n  \nThe year was 1956. I was 9 years old. By some twist of fate, I attended the same public school\nwhere the rich people sent their kids. We were primarily a sugar plantation town. The managers\nof the plantation and the other affluent people of the town, such as doctors, business owners,\nand bankers, sent their children to this school, grades 1 to 6. After grade 6, their children were\ngenerally sent off to private schools. Because my family lived on one side of the street, I went to\nthis school. Had I lived on the other side of the street, I would have gone to a different school,\nwith kids from families more like mine. After grade 6,these kids and I would go on to the public\nintermediate and high school. There was no private school for them or for me.\n  \nMy dad finally put down the paper. I could tell he was thinking.\n  \n\u201cWell, son,\u201d he began slowly. \u201cIf you want to be rich, you have to learn to make money.\u201d\n  \n\u201cHow do I make money?\u201d I asked.\n  \n\u201cWell, use your head, son,\u201d he said, smiling. Which really meant, \u201cThat's all I'm going to tell\nyou,\u201d or \u201cI don't know the answer, so don't embarrass me.\u201d\n  \nA Partnership Is Formed\n  \nThe next morning, I told my best friend, Mike, what my dad had said. As best I could tell, Mike\nand I were the only poor kids in this school. Mike was like me in that he was in this school by a\ntwist of fate. Someone had drawn a jog in the line for the school district, and we wound up in\nschool with the rich kids. We weren't really poor, but we felt as if we were because all the other\nboys had new baseball gloves, new bicycles, new everything.\n  \nMom and dad provided us with the basics, like food, shelter, clothes. :, But that was about it. My\ndad used to say, \u201cIf you want something, work for it.\u201d We wanted things, but there was not\nmuch work available for 9- , year-old boys.\n \nPage 15/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2555, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4c97aa42-d9c7-45fa-aaa8-7ee98594ba6c": {"__data__": {"id_": "4c97aa42-d9c7-45fa-aaa8-7ee98594ba6c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2a2d53c1-8a70-4a05-982e-42171f87238a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "45f4e83607a913f678bf031f00eed770167f15bdab0c1aec9b42f66d0353a958", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "82e2a54d-9dee-490b-92cf-58878c429f9a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "4590d6279f0b7632417c5f8b792540193a4849fd5d427f2ddb6f47b87f999f6b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9038b36b-f5b3-4293-889e-d2794bbaf174", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cb9998cadae731114c540952796bc77c31791e1f403f1a3c2d18e83a6c505141", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "c7dcff4cceef6ddb6dfc64d4056197d32eba4798ac327113bac7e9e105f832b9", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T.

We spent\nall morning coming up with ideas on how to make money. Occasionally we talked about all the\n\u201ccool guys\u201d at Jimmy's beach house having fun. It hurt a little, but that hurt was good, for it\ninspired us to keep thinking of a way to make money. Finally, that afternoon, a bolt of lightning\ncame through our heads. It was an idea Mike had gotten from a science book he had read.\nExcitedly, we shook hands, and the partnership now had a business.\n  \nFor the next several weeks, Mike and I ran around our neighborhood, knocking on doors and\nasking our neighbors if they would save their toothpaste tubes for us. With puzzled looks, most\nadults consented with a smile. Some asked us what we were doing. To which we replied, \u201cWe\ncan't tell you. It's a business secret.\u201d\n  \nMy mom grew distressed as the weeks wore on. We had selected a site next to her washing\nmachine as the place we would stockpile our raw materials. In a brown cardboard box that one\ntime held catsup bottles, our little pile of used toothpaste tubes began to grow.\n  \nFinally my mom put her foot down. The sight of her neighbors' messy, crumpled used\ntoothpaste tubes had gotten to her. \u201cWhat are you boys doing?\u201d she asked. \u201cAnd I don't want to\nhear again that it's a business secret. Do something with this mess or I'm going to throw it out.\u201d\n  \nMike and I pleaded and begged, explaining that we would soon have enough and then we would\nbegin production. We informed her that we were waiting on a couple of neighbors to finish\nusing up their toothpaste so we could have their tubes. Mom granted us a one-week extension.\n  \nThe date to begin production was moved up. The pressure was on. My first partnership was\nalready being threatened with an eviction notice from our warehouse space by my own mom. It\nbecame Mike's job to tell the neighbors to quickly use up their toothpaste, saying their dentist\nwanted them to brush more often anyway. I began to put together the production line.\n  \nOne day my dad drove up with a friend to see two 9-year-old boys in the driveway with a\nproduction line operating at full speed. There was fine white powder everywhere. On a long\ntable were small milk cartons from school, and our family's hibachi grill was glowing with red hot\ncoals at maximum heat.\n  \nDad walked up cautiously, having to park the car at the base of the driveway, since the\nproduction line blocked the carport. As he and his friend got closer, they saw a steel pot sitting\non top of the coals, with the toothpaste tubes being melted down. In those days, toothpaste did\nnot come in plastic tubes. The tubes were made of lead. So once the paint was burned off, the\ntubes were dropped in the small steel pot, melted until they became liquid, and with my mom's\npot holders we were pouring the lead through a small hole in the top of the milk cartons.\n  \nThe milk cartons were filled with plaster-of-Paris.

They were nice words, but we still did not know what to do.\n  \n\u201cSo how come you're not rich, dad?\u201d I asked.\n  \n\u201cBecause I chose to be a school teacher. School teachers really don't think about being rich. We\njust like to teach. I wish I could help you, but I really don't know how to make money.\u201d\n  \nMike and I turned and continued our clean up.\n  \n\u201cI know,\u201d said my dad. \u201cIf you boys want to learn how to be rich, don't ask me.

He's told me several times that your father is brilliant when it comes to\nmaking money.\u201d\n  \n\u201cMy dad?\u201d Mike asked again in disbelief. \u201cThen how come we don't have a nice car and a nice\nhouse like the rich kids at school?\u201d\n  \n\u201cA nice car and a nice house does not necessarily mean you're rich or you know how to make\nmoney,\u201d my dad replied. \u201cJimmy's dad works for the sugar plantation. He's not much different\nfrom me. He works for a company, and I work for the government. The company buys the car\nfor him. The sugar company is in financial trouble, and Jimmy's dad may soon have nothing.\nYour dad is different Mike. He seems to be building an empire, and I suspect in a few years he\nwill be a very rich man.\u201d\n  \nWith that, Mike and I got excited again. With new vigor, we began cleaning up the mess caused\nby our now defunct first business. As we were cleaning, we made plans on how and when to talk\nto Mike's dad. The problem was that Mike's dad worked long hours and often did not come\nhome until late. His father owned warehouses, a construction company, a chain of stores, and\nthree restaurants. It was the restaurants that kept him out late.\n  \nMike caught the bus home after we had finished cleaning up. He was going to talk to his dad\nwhen he got home that night and ask him if he would teach us how to become rich. Mike\npromised to call as soon as he had talked to his dad, even if it was late.\n  \nThe phone rang at 8:30 p.m.\n  \n\u201cOK,\u201d I said. \u201cNext Saturday.\u201d And put the phone down.

Mike met me at the door.\n  \n\u201cDad's on the phone, and he said to wait on the back porch,\u201d Mike said as he opened the door.\n  \nThe old wooden floor creaked as I stepped across the threshold of this aging house. There was\na cheap mat just inside the door. The mat was there to hide the years of wear from countless\nfootsteps that the floor had supported. Although clean, it needed to be replaced.\n  \nI felt claustrophobic as I entered the narrow living room, which was filled with old musty\noverstuffed furniture that today would be collector's items. Sitting on the couch were two\nwomen, a little older than my mom. Across from the women sat a man in workman's clothes.\nHe wore khaki slacks and a khaki shirt, neatly pressed but without starch, and polished work\nbooks. He was about 10 years older than my dad; I'd say about 45 years old. They smiled as\nMike and I walked past them, heading for the kitchen, which lead to the porch that overlooked\nthe back yard. I smiled back shyly.\n  \n\u201cWho are those people?\u201d I asked.\n  \n\u201cOh, they work for my dad. The older man runs his warehouses, and the women are the\nmanagers of the restaurants. And you saw the construction supervisor, who is working on a road\nproject about 50 miles from here. His other supervisor, who is building a track of houses, had\nalready left before you got here.\u201d\n  \n\u201cDoes this go on all the time?\u201d I asked.\n  \n\u201cNot always, but quite often,\u201d said Mike, smiling as he pulled up a chair to sit down next to me.\n  \n\u201cI asked him if he would teach us to make money,\u201d Mike said.\n  \n\u201cOh, and what did he say to that?\u201d I asked with cautious curiosity.\n  \n\u201cWell, he had a funny look on his face at first, and then he said he would make us an offer.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d I said, rocking my chair back against the wall; I sat there perched on two rear legs of the\nchair. Mike did the same thing. \u201cDo you know what the offer is?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo, but we'll soon\nfind out.\u201d Suddenly, Mike's dad burst through the rickety screen door and onto the\n  \nporch. Mike and I jumped to our feet, not out of respect but because we were startled.\n  \n\u201cReady boys?\u201d Mike's dad asked as he pulled up a chair to sit down with us.\n  \nWe nodded our heads as we pulled our chairs away from the wall to sit in front of him.\n  \nHe was a big man, about 6 feet tall and 200 pounds. My dad was taller, about the same weight,\nand five years older than Mike's dad. They sort of looked alike, though not of the same ethnic\nmakeup. Maybe their energy was similar.\n  \n\u201cMike says you want to learn to make money? Is that correct, Robert?\u201d\n  \nI nodded my head quickly, but with a little intimidation.

She was a\nkind and patient woman. She always said that Mike and I reminded her of her two sons who\nwere grown and gone. Although kind, she believed in hard work and she kept us working. She\nwas a task master. We spent three hours taking canned goods off the shelves and, with a feather\nduster, brushing each can to get the dust off, and then re-stacking them neatly. It was\nexcruciatingly boring work.\n  \nMike's dad, whom I call my rich dad, owned nine of these little superettes with large parking\nlots. They were the early version of the 7-11 convenience stores. Little neighborhood grocery\nstores where people bought items such as milk, bread, butter and cigarettes. The problem was,\nthis was Hawaii before air conditioning, and the stores could not close its doors because of the\nheat. On two sides of the store, the doors had to be wide open to the road and parking lot.\nEvery time a car drove by or pulled into the parking lot, dust would swirl and settle in the store.\n  \nHence, we had a job for as long as there was no air conditioning.\n  \nFor three weeks, Mike and I reported to Mrs. Martin and worked our three hours. By noon, our\nwork was over, and she dropped three little dimes in each of our hands. Now, even at the age\nof 9 in the mid-1950s, 30 cents was not too exciting.

Kiyosaki\n \nBy Wednesday of the fourth week, I was ready to quit. I had agreed to work only because I\nwanted to learn to make money from Mike's dad, and now I was a slave for 10 cents an hour.\nOn top of that, I had not seen Mike's dad since that first Saturday.\n  \n\u201cI'm quitting,\u201d I told Mike at lunchtime. The school lunch was miserable. School was boring, and\nnow I did not even have my Saturdays to look forward to. But it was the 30 cents that really got\nto me.\n  \nThis time Mike smiled.\n  \n\u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201d I asked with anger and frustration.\n  \n\u201cDad said this would happen. He said to meet with him when you were ready to quit.\u201d\n  \n\u201cWhat?\u201d I said indignantly. \u201cHe's been waiting for me to get fed up?\u201d\n  \n\u201cSort of,\u201d Mike said. \u201cDad's kind of different. He teaches differently from your dad. Your mom\nand dad lecture a lot. My dad is quiet and a man of few words. You just wait till this Saturday. I'll\ntell him you're ready.\u201d\n  \n\u201cYou mean I've been set up?\u201d\n  \n\u201cNo, not really, but maybe. Dad will explain on Saturday.\u201d\n  \nWaiting in Line on Saturday\n  \nI was ready to face him and I was prepared. Even my real dad was angry with him. My real dad,\nthe one I call the poor one, thought that my rich dad was violating child labor laws and should be\ninvestigated.\n  \nMy educated poor dad told me to demand what I deserve. At least 25 cents an hour. My poor\ndad told me that if I did not get a raise, I was to quit immediately.\n  \n\u201cYou don't need that damned job anyway,\u201d said my poor dad with indignity. At 8 o'clock\nSaturday morning, I was going through the same rickety door of Mike's house.\n  \n\u201cTake a seat and wait in line,\u201d Mike's dad said as I entered. He turned and disappeared into his\nlittle office next to a bedroom.\n  \nI looked around the room and did not see Mike anywhere. Feeling awkward, I cautiously sat\ndown next to the same two women who where there four weeks earlier. They smiled and slid\nacross the couch to make room for me.\n  \nForty-five minutes went by, and I was steaming. The two women had met with him and left\nthirty minutes earlier. An older gentleman was in there for twenty minutes and was also gone.\n  \nThe house was empty, and I sat out in his musty dark living room on a beautiful sunny Hawaiian\nday, waiting to talk to a cheapskate who exploited children. I could hear him rustling around the\noffice, talking on the phone, and ignoring me. I was now ready to walk out, but for some reason\nI stayed.\n  \nFinally, fifteen minutes later, at exactly 9 o'clock, rich dad walked out of his office, said nothing,\nPage 21/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2612, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e18fb5b-6987-43b0-9433-f57cb7727faa": {"__data__": {"id_": "6e18fb5b-6987-43b0-9433-f57cb7727faa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e2ab37aa-2318-4513-a00b-8fcfbb645f6e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "a1a1a67fced79db6849a6e9bddcd6819a8d0533b82b0824b0243910c022d36f8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5cbc6697-d8e2-4192-8d71-adab13ec4278", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "972a3f321e60927630a220e1bc98f08bc622a3b436c63384f1f79cbbbf883fe5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "03a757ba-e563-4154-80f1-b4ff1601e85d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5e67a01093712105b8861ab0d720429b275f3fb7e05226953267fb4eee968c50", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "5ab0bb0b2d9141d35a8696f6a99fd1056f0a32939a70adf004b5e94ddd845bcb", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T.

You'll have lots of friends who really like you because you were such a nice hard-working\nguy. You spent a life playing it safe, doing the right things. But the truth is, you let life push you\ninto submission. Deep down you were terrified of taking risks. You really wanted to win, but the\nfear of losing was greater than the excitement of winning. Deep inside, you and only you will\nknow you didn't go for it. You chose to play it safe.\u201d\n  \nOur eyes met again.

Kiyosaki\nwhile my highly educated, but poor, dad struggled financially all his life. It was a singular point of\nview that made all the difference over a lifetime.\n  \nRich dad said over and over, this point of view, which I call Lesson No. 1.\n  \n\u201cThe poor and the middle class work for money.\u201d \u201cThe rich have money work for them.\u201d\n  \nOn that bright Saturday morning, I was learning a completely different point of view from what I\nhad been taught by my poor dad. At the age of 9, I grew aware that both dads wanted me to\nlearn. Both dads encouraged me to study... but not the same things.\n  \nMy highly educated dad recommended that I do what he did. \u201cSon, I want you to study hard, get\ngood grades, so you can find a safe, secure job with a big company. And make sure it has\nexcellent benefits.\u201d My rich dad wanted me to learn how money works so I could make it work\nfor me. These lessons I would learn through life with his guidance, not because of a classroom.\n  \nMy rich dad continued my first lesson, \u201cI'm glad you got angry about working for 10 cents an\nhour. If you had not gotten angry and had gladly accepted it, I would have to tell you that I could\nnot teach you. You see, true learning takes energy, passion, a burning desire. Anger is a big\npart of that formula, for passion is anger and love combined. When it comes to money, most\npeople want to play it safe and feel secure. So passion does not direct them: Fear does.\u201d\n  \n\u201cSo is that why they'll take a job with low par?\u201d I asked.\n  \n\u201cYes,\u201d said rich dad. \u201cSome people say I exploit people because I don't pay as much as the\nsugar plantation or the government. I say the people exploit themselves. It's their fear, not\nmine.\u201d\n  \n\u201cBut don't you feel you should pay them more?\u201d I asked.\n  \n\u201cI don't have to. And besides, more money will not solve the problem. Just look at your dad. He\nmakes a lot of money, and he still can't pay his bills. Most people, given more money, only get\ninto more debt.\u201d\n  \n\u201cSo that's why the 10 cents an hour,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cIt's a part of the lesson.\u201d\n  \n\u201cThat's right,\u201d smiled rich dad. \u201cYou see, your dad went to school and got an excellent\neducation, so he could get a high-paying job. Which he did. But he still has money problems\nbecause he never learned anything about money at school. On top of that, he believes in\nworking for money.\u201d\n  \n\u201cAnd you don't?\u201d I asked.\n  \n\u201cNo, not really,\u201d said rich dad. \u201cIf you want to learn to work for money, then stay in school.\nThat is a great place to learn to do that. But if you want to learn how to have money work for\nyou, then I will teach you that. But only if you want to learn.\u201d\n  \n\u201cWouldn't everyone want to learn that\u201d I asked.\n  \n\u201cNo,\u201d said rich dad. \u201cSimply because it's easier to learn to work for money, especially if fear is\nyour primary emotion when the subject of money is discussed.\u201d\n  \nPage 25/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2903, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "53516b59-700a-4480-bfb0-db0c5d688ef0": {"__data__": {"id_": "53516b59-700a-4480-bfb0-db0c5d688ef0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d4775f4c-6f31-4de1-acc3-8b796ca67389", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "e803de3c90bb5171b47c9b044c134be32960d102941bd728d24e2a9b59bf3429", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a9568be4-5546-43bb-9f11-a1b6e5e7e9eb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "06c43f649ca2ab6f54fa19433837ec2760c38ce590a9245e66472bb0d23b7085", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2caa0671-a028-40b9-b063-cdf7233de5b9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b0a8a960227c9255bbf46b2663cc24c2892972f519c3c8f9f98b067996ab6900", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "c7f4c19803cb9210cb09ec784d7fe8909d32e64c6bedc1fe419e11aee4e27f4b", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T.

They go to work, get their paycheck,\nbalance their checkbooks, and that's it. On top of that, they wonder why they have money\nproblems. Then, they think that more money will solve the problem. Few realize that it's their\nlack of financial education that is the problem.\u201d\n  \n\u201cSo my dad has tax problems because he doesn't understand money?\u201d I asked, confused.\n  \n\u201cLook,\u201d said rich dad. \u201cTaxes are just one small section on learning how to have money work\nfor you. Today, I just wanted to find out if you still have the passion to learn about money. Most\npeople don't. They want to go to school, learn a profession, have fun at their work, and earn\nlots of money. One day they wake up with big money problems, and then they can't stop\nworking. That's the price of only knowing how to work for money instead of studying how to\nhave money work for you.

The part of me that had\nno price took over. There was a calm and a certainty about money that entered my brain and\nmy soul. I knew Mike had gotten to that point also.\n  \n\u201cGood,\u201d rich dad said softly. \u201cMost people have a price. And they have a price because of\nhuman emotions named fear and greed. First, the fear of being without money motivates us to\nwork hard, and then once we get that paycheck, greed or desire starts us thinking about all the\nwonderful things money can buy. The pattern is then set.\u201d\n  \n\u201cWhat pattern?\u201d I asked.\n  \n\u201cThe pattern of get up, go to work, pay bills, get up, go to work, pay bills... Their lives are then\nrun forever by two emotions, fear and greed. Offer them more money, and they continue the\ncycle by also increasing their spending. This is what I call the Rat Race.\u201d\n  \n\u201cThere is another way?\u201d Mike asked.\n  \n\u201cYes,\u201d said rich dad slowly. \u201cBut only a few people find it.\u201d\n  \n\u201cAnd what is that way?\u201d Mike asked.\n  \n\u201cThat's what I hope you boys will find out as you work and study with me. That is why I took\naway all forms of pay.\u201d\n  \n\u201cAny hints?\u201d Mike asked. \u201cWe're kind of tired of working hard, especially for nothing.\u201d\n  \n\u201cWell, the first step is telling the truth,\u201d said rich dad.\n  \n\u201cWe haven't been lying.\u201d I said.\n  \n\u201cI did not say you were lying.

For millions of people, that old fear keeps them awake all\nnight, causing a night of turmoil and worry.

Let me finish the other emotion, which is desire. Some call it greed, but I prefer\ndesire. It is perfectly normal to desire something better, prettier, more fun or exciting. So\npeople also work for money because of desire. They desire money for the joy they think it can\nbuy. But the joy that money brings is often short lived, and they soon need more money for\nmore joy, more pleasure, more comfort, more security. So they keep working, thinking money\nwill soothe their souls that is troubled by fear and desire. But money cannot do that.\u201d\n  \n\u201cEven rich people?\u201d Mike asked.\n  \n\u201cRich people included,\u201d said rich dad. \u201cIn fact, the reason many rich people are rich is not\nbecause of desire but because of fear.

I have friends who keep working even though they have plenty. I know\npeople who have millions who are more afraid now than when they were poor. They're terrified\nof losing all their money. The fears that drove them to get rich got worse. That weak and needy\npart of their soul is actually screaming louder. They don't want to lose the big houses, the cars,\nthe high life that money has bought them. They worry about what their friends would say if they\nlost all their money. Many are emotionally desperate and neurotic, although they look rich and\nhave more money.\u201d\n  \n\u201cSo is a poor man happier?\u201d I asked.\n  \n\u201cNo, I don't think so,\u201d replied rich dad. \u201cThe avoidance of money is just as psychotic as being\nattached to money.\u201d\n  \nAs if on cue, the town derelict went past our table, stopping by the large rubbish can and\nrummaging around in it.

Kiyosaki\n\u201cYes,\u201d said rich dad. \u201cHe's terrified that you won't be able to earn money and won't fit into\nsociety. Don't get me wrong. He loves you and wants the best for you. And I think his fear is\njustified. An education and a job are important. But it won't handle the fear. You see, that same\nfear that makes him get up in the morning to earn a few bucks is the fear that is causing him to\nbe so fanatical about you going to school.\u201d\n  \n\u201cSo what do you recommend?\u201d I asked.\n  \n\u201cI want to teach you to master the power of money. Not be afraid of it. And they don't teach\nthat in school. If you don't learn it, you become a slave to money.\u201d\n  \nIt was finally making sense. He did want us to widen our views. To . see what Mrs. Martin could\nnot see, his employees could not see, or my dad for that matter. He used examples that\nsounded cruel at the time, but I've never forgotten them. My vision widened that day, and I\ncould begin to see the trap that lay ahead for most people.\n  \n\u201cYou see, we're all employees ultimately. We just work at different levels,\u201d said rich dad. \u201cI just\nwant you boys to have a chance to avoid the trap. The trap caused by those two emotions, fear\nand desire. Use them in your favor, not against you. That's what I want to teach you. I'm not\ninterested in just teaching you to make a pile of money. That won't handle the fear or desire. If\nyou don't first handle fear and desire, and you get rich, you'll only be a high-paid slave.\u201d\n  \n\u201cSo how do we avoid the trap?\u201d I asked.\n  \n\u201cThe main cause of poverty or financial struggle is fear and ignorance, not the economy or the\ngovernment or the rich. It's self-inflicted fear and ignorance that keeps people trapped. So you\nboys go to school and get your college degrees. I'll teach you how to stay out of the trap.\u201d\n  \nThe pieces of the puzzle were appearing. My highly educated dad had a great education and a\ngreat career. But school never told him how to handle money or his fears. It became clear that I\ncould learn different and important things from two fathers.\n  \n\u201cSo you've been talking about the fear of not having money. How does the desire of money\naffect our thinking?\u201d Mike asked.\n  \n\u201cHow did you feel when I tempted you with a pay raise? Did you notice your desires rising?\u201d\n  \nWe nodded our heads.\n  \n\u201cBy not giving in to your emotions, you were able to delay your reactions and think. That is\nmost important. We will always have emotions of fear and greed. From here on in, it is most\nimportant for you to use those emotions to your advantage and for the long term, and not\nsimply let your emotions run you by controlling your thinking. Most people use fear and greed\nagainst themselves. That's the start of ignorance. Most people live their lives chasing paychecks,\npay raises and job security because of the emotions of desire and fear, not really questioning\nwhere those emotion-driven thoughts are leading them. It's just like the picture of a donkey,\ndragging a cart, with its owner dangling a carrot just in front of the donkey's nose. The donkey's\nowner may be going where he wants to go, but the donkey is chasing an illusion.

And as you get older, your toys get more expensive. A new car, a boat and a big house\nto impress your friends,\u201d said rich dad with a smile. \u201cFear pushes you out the door, and desire\ncalls to you. Enticing you toward the rocks. That's the trap.\u201d\n  \n\u201cSo what's the answer,\u201d Mike asked.\n  \n\u201cWhat intensifies fear and desire is ignorance. That is why rich people with lots of money often\nhave more fear the richer they get. Money is the carrot, the illusion. If the donkey could see the\nwhole picture, it might rethink its choice to chase the carrot.\u201d\n  \nRich dad went on to explain that a human's life is a struggle between ignorance and\nillumination.\n  \nHe explained that once a person stops searching for information and knowledge of one's self,\nignorance sets in. That struggle is a moment-to-moment decision-to learn to open or close one's\nmind.\n  \n\u201cLook, school is very, very important.

Every culture needs teachers, doctors, mechanics, artists,\ncooks, business people, police officers, firefighters, soldiers. Schools train them so our culture\ncan thrive and flourish,\u201d said rich dad. \u201cUnfortunately, for many people, school is the end, not\nthe beginning.\u201d\n  \nThere was a long silence. Rich dad was smiling. I did not comprehend everything he said that\nday. But as with most great teachers, whose words continue to teach for years, often long after\nthey're gone, his words are still with me today.\n  \n\u201cI've been a little cruel today,\u201d said rich dad. \"Cruel for a reason. I want you to always remember\nthis talk. I want you to always think of Mrs. Martin.\n  \nI want you always to think of the donkey. Never forget, because your two emotions, fear and\ndesire, can lead you into life's biggest trap, if you're not aware of them controlling your thinking.\nTo spend your life living in fear, never exploring your dreams, is cruel. To work hard for money,\nthinking that money will buy you things that will make you happy is also cruel. To wake up in\nthe middle of the night terrified about paying bills is a horrible way to live. To live a life dictated\nby the size of a paycheck is not really a life. Thinking that a job will make you feel secure is lying\nto yourself. That's cruel, and that's the trap I want you to avoid, if possible. I've seen how\nmoney runs people's lives. Don't let that happen to you.

Instead of just getting up\nand going to work to solve your problems, just because the fear of not having the money to pay\nyour bills is scaring you. Thinking would be taking the time to ask yourself a question. A question\nlike, `Is working harder at this the best solution to this problem?' Most people are so terrified at\nnot telling themselves the truth-that fear is in control-that they cannot think, and instead run out\nthe door. Tar baby is in control. That's what I mean by choosing your thoughts.\u201d\n  \n\u201cAnd how do we do that?\u201d Mike asked.\n  \n\"That's what I will be teaching you. I'll be teaching you to have a choice of thoughts to consider,\nrather than knee-jerk reacting, like gulping down your morning coffee and running out the door.\n  \n\u201cRemember what I said before: A job is only a short-term solution to a long-term problem. Most\npeople have only one problem in mind, and it's short term. It's the bills at the end of the month,\nthe Tar Baby. Money now runs their lives. Or should I say the fear and ignorance about money.\nSo they do as their parents did, get up every day and go work for money. Not having the time\nto say, `Is there another way?' Their emotions now control their thinking, not their heads.\u201d\n  \n\u201cCan you tell the difference between emotions thinking and the head thinking?\u201d Mike asked.\n  \n\u201cOh, yes. I hear it all the time,\u201d said rich dad. \u201cI hear things like, `Well, everyone has to work.'\nOr `The rich are crooks.' Or `I'll get another job. I deserve this raise. You can't push me\naround.' Or `I like this job because it's secure.' Instead of, `Is there something I'm missing here?'\nwhich breaks the emotional thought, and gives you time to think clearly.\u201d\n  \nI must admit, it was a great lesson to be getting. To know when someone was speaking out of\nemotions or out of clear thought. It was a lesson that served me well for life. Especially when I\nwas the one speaking out of reaction and not from clear thought.\n  \nAs we headed back to the store, rich dad explained that the rich really did \u201cmake money.\u201d They\ndid not work for it. He went on to explain that when Mike and I were casting 5-cent pieces out\nof lead, thinking we were making money, we were very close to thinking the way the rich think.\nThe problem was that it was illegal for us to do it. It was legal for the government and banks to\ndo it, but not us. He explained that there are legal ways to make money and illegal ways.\n  \nRich dad went on to explain that the rich know that money is an illusion, truly like the carrot for\nthe donkey. It's only out of fear and greed that the illusion of money is held together by billions\nof people thinking that money is real. Money is really made up. It was only because of the\nillusion of confidence and the ignorance of the masses that the house of cards stood standing.\n\u201cIn fact,\u201d he said, \u201cin many ways the donkey's carrot was more valuable than money.\u201d\n  \nHe talked about the gold standard that America was on, and that each dollar bill was actually a\nsilver certificate. What concerned him was the rumor that we would someday go off the gold\nstandard and our dollars would no longer be silver certificates.\n  \n\u201cWhen that happens, boys, all hell is going to break loose.

Keep using your brain, work for free, and soon your mind will show you ways of making\nmoney far beyond what I could ever pay you.

Most people never see these opportunities because\nthey're looking for money and security, so that's all they get. The moment you see one\nopportunity, you will see them for the rest of your life. The moment you do that, I'll teach you\nsomething else. Learn this, and you'll avoid one of life's biggest traps. You'll never, ever, touch\nthat Tar Baby.\u201d\n  \nMike and I picked up our things from the store and waved goodbye to Mrs. Martin. We went\nback to the park, to the same picnic bench, and spent several more hours thinking and talking.\n  \nWe spent the next week at school, thinking and talking. For two more weeks, we kept thinking,\ntalking, and working for free.\n  \nAt the end of the second Saturday, I was again saying goodbye to Mrs. Martin and looking at the\ncomic-book stand with a longing gaze. The hard thing about not even getting 30 cents every\nSaturday was that I didn't have any money to buy comic books. Suddenly, as Mrs. Martin was\nsaying goodbye to Mike and me, I saw something she was doing that I had never seen her do\nbefore. I mean, I had seen her do it, but I never took notice of it.\n  \nMrs. Martin was cutting the front page of the comic book in half. She was keeping the top half\nof the comic book cover and throwing the rest of the comic book into a large brown cardboard\nbox. When I asked her what she did with the comic books, she said, \u201cI throw them away. I give\nthe top half of the cover back to the comic-book distributor for credit when he brings in the new\ncomics. He's coming in an hour.\u201d\n  \nMike and I waited for an hour. Soon the distributor arrived and I asked him if we could have the\ncomic books. To which he replied, \u201cYou can have them if you work for this store and do not\nresell them.\u201d\n  \nOur partnership was revived. Mike's mom had a spare room in the basement that no one used.\nWe cleaned it out, and began piling hundreds of comic books in that room. Soon our comic-\nbook library was open to the public. We hired Mike's younger sister, who loved to study, to be\nhead librarian. She charged each child 10 cents admission to the library, which was open from\n2:30 to 4:30 p.m. every day after school. The customers, the children of the neighborhood,\ncould read as many comics as they could in two hours. It was a bargain for them since a comic\ncosts 10 cents each, and they could read five or six in two hours.\n  \nMike's sister would check the kids as they left, to make sure they weren't borrowing any comic\nbooks. She also kept the books, logging in how many kids showed up each day, who they were,\nPage 37/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3250, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fb8a6511-6d8f-4625-965f-42b3a91a31a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "fb8a6511-6d8f-4625-965f-42b3a91a31a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d7d11ce5-086b-45eb-a015-6a3e1b401b57", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "47722f61d0defa0ce8339b8aec954cac746e80346b29f93fc59941e1bee53bcc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8ee5c2f5-dd97-4ac1-933a-710362f7dff1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "b93311d78fe8c49e2988e8fe208f6787332fb5429d9bc6fc70873e8f2107e85e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ce1ffc5b-b95f-4556-9999-0aced20b1917", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "987ddb8b87e169ebe8b58853a52291872ea166cd58ffdec24c5c008629f83697", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "5e0c739b1d4e76d103f21623a462918bf6c02883351d10ee83c4b14e85702b89", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T.

We see each other once or twice a year on the golf course. He and his wife\nare wealthier than you could imagine. Rich dad's empire is in great hands, and Mike is now\ngrooming his son to take his place, as his dad had groomed us.\n  \nIn 1994, I retired at the age of 47, and my wife, Kim, was 37. Retirement does not mean not\nworking. To my wife and me, it means that barring unforeseen cataclysmic changes, we can\nwork or not work, and our wealth grows automatically, staying way ahead of inflation. I guess it\nmeans freedom. The assets are large enough to grow by themselves. It's like planting a tree.\nYou water it for years and then one day it doesn't need you anymore. It's roots have gone down\ndeep enough. Then, the tree provides shade for your enjoyment.\n  \nMike chose to run the empire and I chose to retire.\n  \nWhenever I speak to groups of people, they often ask what I would recommend or what could\nthey do? \u201cHow do they get started?\u201d \u201cIs there a good book I would recommend?\u201d \u201cWhat should\nthey do to prepare their children?\u201d \u201cWhat is the secret to success?\u201d \u201cHow do I make millions?\u201d I\nam always reminded of this article I was once given. It goes as follows.\n  \nTHE RICHEST BUSINESSMEN\n  \nIn 1923 a group of our greatest leaders and richest businessmen held a meeting at the\nEdgewater Beach hotel in Chicago. Among them were Charles Schwab, head of the largest\nindependent steel company; Samuel Instill, president of the world's largest utility; Howard\nHopson, head of the largest gas company; Ivar Kreuger president of the International Match\nCo., one of the world's largest companies at that time; Leon Frazier, president of the Bank of\nInternational Settlements; Richard Whitney, president of the New York Stock Exchange; Arthur\nCotton and Jesse Livermore, two of the biggest stock speculators; and Albert Fall, a member of\nPresident Harding's cabinet. Twenty five years later nine of them (those listed above) ended as\nfollows. Schwab died penniless after living for five years on borrowed money. Instill died broke\nliving in a foreign land. Kreuger and Cotton also died broke. Hopson went insane. Whitney and\nAlbert Fall were just released from prison. Fraser and Livermore committed suicide.\n  \nI doubt if anyone can say what really happened to these men. If you look at the date, 1923, it\nwas just before the 1929 market crash and the Great Depression, which I suspect had a great\nimpact on these men and their lives. The point is this: Today we live in times of greater and\nfaster change than these men did. I suspect there will be many booms and busts in the next 25\nyears that will parallel the ups and downs these men faced. I am concerned that too many\npeople are focused too much on money and not their greatest wealth, which is their education.\nIf people are prepared to be flexible, keep an open mind and learn, they will grow richer and\nricher through the changes. If they think money will solve problems, I am afraid those people\nwill have a rough ride. Intelligence solves problems and produces money.

Kiyosaki\nfinancial intelligence is money soon gone.\n  \nMost people fail to realize that in life, it's not how much money you make, it's how much money\nyou keep. We have all heard stories of lottery winners who are poor, then suddenly rich, then\npoor again. They win millions and are soon back to where they started. Or stories of\nprofessional athletes, who, at the age of 24, are earning millions of dollars a year, and are\nsleeping under a bridge by age 34. In the paper this morning, as I write this, there is a story of a\nyoung basketball player who a year ago had millions. Today, he claims his friends, attorney and\naccountant took his money, and now he works at a car wash for minimum wage.\n  \nHe is only 29. He was fired from the car wash because he refused to take off his championship\nring as he was wiping off the cars, so his story made the newspaper. He is appealing his\ntermination, claiming hardship and discrimination and that the ring is all he has left. He claims\nthat if you take that away, he'll crumble.\n  \nIn 1997, I know so many people who are becoming instant millionaires. It's the Roaring '20s\none more time. And while I am glad people have been getting richer and richer, I only caution\nthat in the long run, it's not how much you make, it's how much you keep, and how many\ngenerations you keep it.\n  \nSo when people ask, \u201cWhere do I get started?\u201d or \u201cTell me how to get rich quick,\u201d they often\nare greatly disappointed with my answer. I simply say to them what my rich dad said back to me\nwhen I was a little kid. \u201cIf you want to be rich, you need to be financially literate.\u201d\n  \nThat idea was drummed into my head every time we were together. As I said, my educated dad\nstressed the importance of reading books, while my rich dad stressed the need to master\nfinancial literacy.\n  \nIf you are going to build the Empire State Building, the first thing you need to do is dig a deep\nhole and pour a strong foundation. If you are going to build a home in the suburbs, all you need\nto do is pour a 6-inch slab of concrete. Most people, in their drive to get rich, are trying to build\nan Empire State Building on a 6-inch slab.\n  \nOur school system, having been created in the Agrarian Age, still believes in homes with no\nfoundation. Dirt floors are still the rage. So kids graduate from school with virtually no financial\nfoundation. One day, sleepless and deep in debt in suburbia, living the American Dream, they\ndecide that the answer to their financial problems is to find a way to get rich quick.\n  \nConstruction on the skyscraper begins. It goes up quickly, and soon, instead of the Empire State\nBuilding, we have the Leaning Tower of Suburbia. The sleepless nights return.\n  \nAs for Mike and me in our adult years, both of our choices were possible because we were\ntaught to pour a strong financial foundation when we were just kids.\n  \nNow, accounting is possibly the most boring subject in the world. It also could be the most\nconfusing. But if you want to be rich, long term, it could be the most important subject.

Kiyosaki\ncreated a simple way to teach us. For years he only drew pictures and used words. Mike and I\nunderstood the simple drawings, the jargon, the movement of money, and then in later years,\nrich dad began adding numbers. Today, Mike has gone on to master much more complex and\nsophisticated accounting analysis because he has had to. He has a billion-dollar empire to run. I\nam not as sophisticated because my empire is smaller, yet we come from the same simple\nfoundation. In the following pages, I offer to you the same simple line drawings Mike's dad\ncreated for us. Though simple, those drawings helped guide two little boys in building great sums\nof wealth on a solid and deep foundation.\n  \nRule One. You must know the difference between an asset and a liability, and buy assets. If you\nwant to be rich, this is all you need to know. It is Rule No. 1. It is the only rule. This may sound\nabsurdly simple, but most people have no idea how profound this rule is. Most people struggle\nfinancially because they do not know the difference between an asset and a liability.\n  \n\u201cRich people acquire assets. The poor and middle class acquire liabilities, but they think they are\nassets\u201d\n  \nWhen rich dad explained this to Mike and me, we thought he was kidding. Here we were,\nnearly teenagers and waiting for the secret to getting rich, and this was his answer. It was so\nsimple that we had to stop for a long time to think about it.\n  \n\u201cWhat is an asset?\u201d asked Mike.\n  \n\u201cDon't worry right now,\u201d said rich dad. \u201cJust let the idea sink in. If you can comprehend the\nsimplicity, your life will have a plan and be financially easy. It is simple; that is why the idea is\nmissed.\u201d\n  \n\u201cYou mean all we need to know is what an asset is, acquire them and we'll be rich?\u201d I asked.\n  \nRich dad nodded his head. \u201cIt's that simple.\u201d\n  \n\u201cIf it's that simple, how come everyone is not rich?\u201d I asked.\n  \nRich dad smiled. \"Because people do not know the difference between an asset and a liability.\"\n  \nI remember asking, \u201cHow could adults be so silly. If it is that simple, if it is that important, why\nwould everyone not want to find out?\u201d\n  \nIt took our rich dad only a few minutes to explain what assets and liabilities were.\n  \nAs an adult, I have difficulty explaining it to other adults. Why? Because adults are smarter. In\nmost cases, the simplicity of the idea escapes most adults because they have been educated\ndifferently. They have been educated by other educated professionals, such as bankers,\naccountants, real estate agents, financial planners, and so forth. The difficulty comes in asking\nadults to unlearn, or become children again. An intelligent adult often feels it is demeaning to\npay attention to simplistic definitions.\n  \nRich dad believed in the KISS principle-\u201cKeep It Simple Stupid\u201d-so he kept it simple for two\nyoung boys, and that made the financial foundation strong.\n  \nSo what causes the confusion?

It's not the words, but the story the words are telling you.\n  \nMany people read, but do not understand much. It's called reading comprehension. And we all\nhave different abilities when it comes to reading comprehension. For example, I recently bought\na new VCR. It came with an instruction book that explained how to program the VCR. All I\nwanted to do was record my favorite TV show on Friday night. I nearly went crazy trying to read\nthe manual. Nothing in my world is more complex than learning how to program my VCR. I\ncould read the words, but I understood nothing. I get an \u201cA\u201d for recognizing the words. I get an\n\u201cF\u201d for comprehension.

The rich are rich because they are more literate in different areas\nthan people who struggle financially. So if you want to be rich and maintain your wealth, it's\nimportant to be financially literate, in words as well as numbers.\n  \nThe arrows in the diagrams represent the flow of cash, or \u201ccash flow.\u201d Numbers alone really\nmean little. Just as words alone mean little. It's the story that counts. In financial reporting,\nreading numbers is looking for the plot, the story. The story of where the cash is flowing. In 80\npercent of most families, the financial story is a story of working hard in an effort to get ahead.\nNot because they don't make money. But because they spend their lives buying liabilities instead\nof assets.\n  \nFor instance, this is the cash flow pattern of a poor person, or a young person still at home:\n  \nJob (provides income)-> Expenses(Taxes Food Rent Clothes Fun Transportation)\n  \nAsset (none)\n  \nLiability (none)\n  \nThis is the cash flow pattern of a person in the middle class:\n  \nJob (provides income)-> Expenses(Taxes Food Mortgage Clothes Fun Transportation)\n  \nAsset (none)\n  \nLiability (Mortgage Consumer loans Credit Cards)\n  \nThis is the cash flow pattern of a wealthy person:\n  \nAssets(stocks bonds notes real estate intellectual property)->income (dividends interest rental\nincome royalties)\n  \nLiabilities (none)\n  \nAll of these diagrams were obviously oversimplified. Everyone has living expenses, the need for\nfood, shelter and clothing.\n  \nThe diagrams show the flow of cash through a poor, middle class or wealthy person's life. It is\nthe cash flow that tells the story. It is the story of how a person handles their money, what they\ndo after they get the money in their hand.\n  \nThe reason I started with the story of the richest men in America is to illustrate the flaw in the\nthinking of so many people. The flaw is that money will solve all problems. That is why I cringe\nwhenever 1 hear people ask me how to get rich quicker. Or where do they start? I often hear,\n\u201cI'm in debt so I need lo make more money.\u201d\n  \nBut more money will often not solve the problem; in fact, it may actually accelerate the\nproblem. Money often makes obvious our tragic human flaws. Money often puts a spotlight on\nwhat we do not know. That is why, all too often, a person who comes into a sudden windfall of\ncash-let's say an inheritance, a pay raise or lottery winnings-soon returns to the same financial\nmess, if not worse than the mess they were in before they received the money.

Thus, the\nsaying, \u201cA fool and his money is one big party,\u201d I have said many times that we go to school to\ngain scholastic skills and professional skills, both important. We learn to make money with our\nprofessional skills. In the 1960s, when I was in high school, if someone did well in school\nacademically, almost immediately people assumed this bright student would go on to be a\nmedical doctor. Often no one asked the child if they wanted to be a doctor. It was assumed. It\nwas the profession with the promise of the greatest financial reward.\n  \nToday, doctors are facing financial challenges I would not wish on my worst enemy; insurance\ncompanies taking control of the business, managed health care, government intervention, and\nmalpractice suits, to name a few. Today, kids want to be basketball stars, golfers like Tiger\nWoods, computer nerds, movie stare, rock stars, beauty queens, or traders on Wall Street.\nSimply because that is where the fame, money and prestige is. That is the reason it is so hard to\nmotivate kids in school today. They know that professional success is no longer solely linked to\nacademic success, as it once was.\n  \nBecause students leave school without financial skills, millions of educated people pursue their\nprofession successfully, but later find themselves struggling financially. They work harder, but\ndon't get ahead. What is missing from their education is not how to make money, but how to\nspend money-what to do after you make it. It's called financial aptitude-what you do with the\nmoney once you make it, how to keep people from taking it from you, how long you keep it,\nand how hard that money works for you. Most people cannot tell why they struggle financially\nbecause they don't understand cash flow. A person can be highly educated, professionally\nsuccessful and financially illiterate. These people often work harder than they need to because\nthey learned how to work hard, but not how to have their money work for them.\n  \nThe story of bow the quest for a Financial Dream turns into a financial nightmare. The moving-\npicture show of hard-working people has a set pattern. Recently married, the happy, highly\neducated young couple move in together, in one of their cramped rented apartments.\nImmediately, they realize that they are saving money because two can live as cheaply as\n  \none.\n  \nThe problem is, the apartment is cramped. They decide to save money to buy their dream\nhome so they can have kids. They now have two incomes, and they begin to focus on their\ncareers.\n  \nTheir incomes begin to increase.\n  \nAs their incomes go up...their expenses go up as well.\n  \nThe No. 1 expense for most people is taxes. Many people think it's income tax, but for most\nAmericans their highest tax is Social Security. As an employee, it appears as if the Social\nSecurity tax combined with the Medicare tax rate is roughly 7.5 percent, but it's really 15\npercent since the employer must match the Social Security amount. In essence, it is money the\nemployer cannot pay you. On top of that, you still have to pay income tax on the amount\ndeducted from your wages for Social Security tax, income you never receive because it went\ndirectly to Social Security through withholding. Then, their liabilities go up.\nPage 45/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3506, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5edb586b-12d5-4531-8456-cfdb4cba5223": {"__data__": {"id_": "5edb586b-12d5-4531-8456-cfdb4cba5223", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c4086550-dc07-4c22-abb5-ebb6610b039a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "b09fbc9971974eb92dc6358afd216a0e3e2c175fafb0fe88cb553802616213ed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fb4f5542-eb28-4771-ba2a-771570489fc9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "2bb3083bb0c44886006496988993495d18ea7afee41a78b73a3198b032180770", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d29a6b8d-d265-4abd-ab3e-88a36b2de2aa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f6ff63bceb4fa78bb99d0b64f46e912f35b1ae8c32efd6e4321db5fed4403fe2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "3fdeb2cad62f1436b9fa51bc0f6277722038a37ba6c71b103239c9b37eb791cc", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T.

Once in their house, they have a\nnew tax, called property tax. Then, they buy a new car, new furniture and new appliances to\nmatch [heir new house. Ail of a sudden, they wake up and their liabilities column is full of\nmortgage debt and credit-card debt.\n  \nThey're now trapped in the rat race. A child comes along. They work harder. The process\nrepeats itself. More money and higher taxes, also called bracket creep, A credit card comes in\nthe mail. They use it. It maxes out. A loan company calls and says their greatest \u201casset,\u201d their\nhome, has appreciated in value. The company offers a \u201cbill consolidation\u201d loan, because their\ncredit is so good, and tells them the intelligent thing to do is clear off the high-interest consumer\ndebt by paying off their credit card. And besides, interest on their home is a tax deduction. They\ngo for it, and pay off those high-interest credit cards. They breathe a sigh of relief. Their credit\ncards are paid off.\n  \nThey've now folded their consumer debt into their home mortgage. Their payments go down\nbecause they extend their debt over 30 years. It is the smart thing to do.\n  \nTheir neighbor calls to invite them to go shopping-the Memorial Day sale is on. A chance to\nsave some money. They say to themselves, \u201cI won't buy anything. I'll just go look.\u201d But just in\ncase they find something, they tuck that clean credit card inside their wallet.\n  \nI run into this young couple all the time.

He use to tell us over and over again. \u201cAn intelligent person hires people who are\nmore intelligent than they are.\u201d So Mike and I had the benefit of spending hours listening to\nand, in the process, learning From\n  \nintelligent people.\n  \nBut because of this, both Mike and I just could not go along with the standard dogma that our\nteachers preached, And that caused the problems. Whenever the teacher said, \u201cIf you don't get\ngood grades, you won't do well in the real world,\u201d Mike and I just raised our eyebrows. When\nwe were told to follow set procedures and not deviate from the rules, we could see how this\nschooling process actually discouraged creativity. We started to understand why our rich dad told\nus that schools were designed to produce good employees instead of employers.\n  \nOccasionally Mike or I would ask our teachers how what we studied was applicable, or we asked\nwhy we never studied money and how it worked. To the later question, we often got the answer\nthat money was not important, that if we excelled in our education, the money would follow.\n  \nThe more we knew about the power of money, the more distant we grew from the teachers and\nour classmates.\n  \nMy highly educated dad never pressured me about my grades. I often wondered why. But we did\nbegin to argue about money. By the time I was 16, I probably had a far better foundation with\nmoney than both my mom and dad. I could keep books, I listened to tax accountants, corporate\nattorneys, bankers, real estate brokers, investors and so forth. My dad talked to teachers.\n  \nOne day, my dad was telling me why our home was his greatest investment. A not-too-pleasant\nargument took place when I showed him why I thought a house was not a good investment.\n  \nThe following diagram illustrates the difference in perception between my rich dad and my poor\ndad when it came to their homes. One dad thought his house was an asset, and the other dad\nthought it was a liability.\n  \nI remember when I drew a diagram for my dad showing him the direction of cash flow. I also\nshowed him the ancillary expenses that went along with owning the home. A bigger home\nmeant bigger expenses, and the cash flow kept going out through the expense column.\n  \nToday, I am still challenged on the idea of a house not being an asset. And 1 know that for\nmany people, it is their dream as well as their largest investment. And owning your own home is\nbetter than nothing. I simply offer an alternate way of looking at this popular dogma. If my wife\nand I were to buy a bigger, more flashy house we realize it would not be an asset, it would be a\n  \nliability, since it would take money out of\n  \nour pocket.\n  \nSo here is the argument I put forth. I really do not expect most people to agree with it because\na nice home is an emotional thing.

Kiyosaki\n1.\t When it comes to houses, I point out that most people work all their lives paying for a\nhome they never own. In other words, most people buy a new house every so many years, each\ntime incurring a new 30-year loan to pay off the previous one.\n  \n2.\t Even though people receive a tax deduction for interest on mortgage payments, they pay\nfor all their other expenses with after-tax dollars. Even after they pay off their mortgage.\n  \n3.\t Property taxes. My wife's parents were shocked when the property taxes on their home\nwent to $1,000 a month. This was after they had retired, so the increase put a strain on their\nretirement budget, and they felt forced to move.\n  \n4 Houses do not always go up in value. In 1997, I still have friends who owe a million dollars for\na home that will today sell for only $700,000.\n  \n5. The greatest losses of all are those from missed opportunities. If all your money is tied up in\nyour house, you may be forced to work harder because your money continues blowing out of\nthe expense column, instead of adding to the asset column, the classic middle class cash flow\npattern. If a young couple would put more money into their asset column early on, their later\nyears would get easier, especially as they prepared to send their children to college. Their assets\nwould have grown and would be available to help cover expenses. All too often, a house only\nserves as a vehicle for incurring a home-equity loan to pay for mounting expenses. In summary,\nthe end result in making a decision to own a house that is too expensive in lieu of starting an\ninvestment portfolio early on impacts an individual in at least the following three ways:\n  \n1. Loss of time, during which other assets could have grown in value.\n  \n2. Loss of additional capital, which could have been invested instead of paying for high-\nmaintenance expenses related directly to the home.\n  \n3. Loss of education. Too often, people count their house, savings and retirement plan as all\nthey have in their asset column. Because they have no money to invest, they simply do not\ninvest. This costs them investment\n  \nexperience. Most never become what the investment world calls a \u201csophisticated investor.\u201d And\nthe best investments are usually first sold to \u201csophisticated investors,\u201d who then turn around and\nsell them to the people playing it safe. I am not saying don't buy a house. I am saying,\nunderstand the difference between an asset and a liability. When I want a bigger house, I first\nbuy assets that will generate the cash flow to pay for the house.\n  \nMy educated dad's personal financial statement best demonstrates the life of someone in the rat\nrace. His expenses seem to always keep up with his income, never allowing him to invest in\nassets. As a result, his liabilities, such as his mortgage and credit card debts are larger than his\nassets.

The asset column\ngenerates more than enough income to cover expenses, with the balance reinvested into the\nasset column. The asset column continues to grow and, therefore, the income it produces grows\nwith it.\n  \nThe result being: The rich get richer!\n  \nWhy the Rich Get Richer\n  \nIncome -> Assets -> More Income Expenses are low, Liabilities are low\n  \nThe middle class finds itself in a constant state of financial struggle. Their primary- income is\nthrough wages, and as their wages increase, so do their taxes. Their expenses tend to increase\nin equal increments as their wages increase; hence the phrase \u201cthe rat race.\u201d They treat their\nhome as their primary asset, instead on investing in income-producing assets.\n  \nWhy the Middle Class Struggle\n  \nIncome goes up, Expenses go up\n  \nAssets do not increase, Liabilities do increase\n  \nThis pattern of treating your home as an investment and the philosophy that a pay raise means\nyou can buy a larger home or spend more is the foundation of today's debt-ridden society. This\nprocess of increased spending throws families into greater debt and into more financial\nuncertainty, even though they may be advancing in their jobs and receiving pay raises on a\nregular basis. This is high risk living caused by weak financial education.\n  \nThe massive loss of jobs in the 1990s-the downsizing of businesses-has brought to light how\nshaky the middle class really is financially. Suddenly, company pension plans are being replaced\nby 401k plans. Social Security is obviously in trouble and cannot be looked at as a source for\nretirement. Panic has sei in for the middle class. The good thing today is that many of these\npeople have recognized these issues and have begun buying mutual funds. This increase in\ninvesting is largely responsible for the huge rally we have seen in the stock market. Today, there\nare more and more mutual funds being created to answer the demand by the middle class.\n  \nMutual funds are popular because they represent safety. Average mutual fund buyers are too\nbusy working to pay taxes and mortgages, save for their children's college and pay off credit\ncards. They do not have time to study to learn how to invest, so they rely on the expertise of\nthe manager of a mutual fund. Also, because the mutual fund includes many different types of\ninvestments, they feel their money is safer because ii is \u201cdiversified.\u201d\n  \nPage 50/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2759, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da8e6f7e-bb42-482e-86ae-2a66d2ce2d21": {"__data__": {"id_": "da8e6f7e-bb42-482e-86ae-2a66d2ce2d21", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "49858d81-c2a8-47a2-b59e-0af23d5d087c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "df9ac8dce5149968b9c3a009c14057488a584f9e60132e03de972d0a1aebfe9d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2cf0af69-c115-49fd-8975-434ab74a4744", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "92074894c130eee6b3646140bc1e90e6cfe7117932206612a3287e6e477a20b4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1b23f425-562d-43b9-834e-404df0ad0bdb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "246fa5bc7e57355181600532b82862c3c684812be64f6e426cd8bf6952c310e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "7e84d6de4fe0c5dcc3f4967f1a0d2dddf8306493fc8bef587d7b762b4dae717f", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T. Kiyosaki\nThis group of educated middle class subscribes to the \u201cdiversify\u201d dogma put out by mutual fund\nbrokers and financial planners. Play it safe. Avoid risk.\n  \nThe real tragedy is that the lack of early financial education is what creates the risk faced by\naverage middle class people. The reason they have to play it safe is because their financial\npositions are tenuous at best. Their balance sheets are not balanced. They are loaded with\nliabilities, with no real assets that generate income. Typically, their only source of income is\ntheir paycheck. Their livelihood becomes entirely dependent on their employer.\n  \nSo when genuine \u201cdeals of a lifetime\u201d come along, those same people cannot take advantage of\nthe opportunity. They must play it safe, simply because they are working so hard, are taxed to\nthe max, and are loaded with debt.\n  \nAs I said at the start of this section, the most important rule is to know the difference between\nan asset and a liability. Once you understand the difference, concentrate your efforts on only\nbuying income-generating assets. That's the best way to get started on a path to becoming rich.\nKeep doing that, and your asset column will grow. Focus on keeping liabilities and expenses\ndown. This will make more money available to continue pouring into the asset column. Soon,\nthe asset base will be so deep that you can afford to look at more speculative investments.\nInvestments that may have returns of 100 percent to infinity. Investments that for $5,000 are\nsoon turned into $1 million or more. Investments that the middle class calls \u201ctoo risky.\u201d The\ninvestment is not risky. It's the lack of simple financial intelligence, beginning with financial\nliteracy, that causes the individual to be \u201ctoo risky,\u201d\n  \nIf you do what the masses do, you get the following picture.\n  \nIncome = Work for Owner Expense = Work for Government Asset = (none) Liability = Work for\nBank\n  \nAs an employee who is also a homeowner, your working efforts are generally as follows:\n  \n1.\t You work for someone else. Most people, working for a paycheck, are making the owner,\nor the shareholders richer. Your efforts and success will help provide for the owner's success\nand retirement.\n  \n2.\t You work for the government. The government takes its share from your paycheck before\nyou even see it. By working harder, you simply increase the amount of taxes taken by the\ngovernment - most people work from January to May just for the government.\n  \n3.\t You work for the bank. After taxes, your next largest expense is usually your mortgage and\ncredit card debt.\n  \nThe problem with simply working harder is that each of these three levels takes a greater share\nof your increased efforts. You need to learn how to have your increased efforts benefit you and\nyour family directly.\n  \nOnce you have decided to concentrate on minding your own business, how do you set your\ngoals?

Kiyosaki\nAs their assets grow, how do they measure the extent of their success? When does someone\nrealize that they are rich, that they have wealth? As well as having my own definitions for assets\nand liabilities, I also have my own definition for wealth. Actually I borrowed it from a man named\nBuckminster Fuller. Some call him a quack, and others call him a living genius. Years ago he got\nall the architects buzzing because he applied for a patent in 1961 for something called a\ngeodesic dome. But in the application, Fuller also said something about wealth. It was pretty\nconfusing at first, but after reading it for awhile, it began to make some sense: Wealth is a\nperson's ability to survive so many number of days forward... or if I stopped working today, how\nlong could I survive?\n  \nUnlike net worth-the difference between your assets and liabilities, which is often filled with a\nperson's expensive junk and opinions of what things are worth-this definition creates the\npossibility for developing a truly accurate measurement. I could now measure and really know\nwhere I was in terms of my goal to become financially independent.\n  \nAlthough net worth often includes these non-cash-producing assets, like stuff you bought that\nnow sits in your garage, wealth measures how much money your money is making and,\ntherefore, your financial survivability.\n  \nWealth is the measure of the cash flow from the asset column compared with the expense\ncolumn.\n  \nLet's use an example. Let's say I have cash flow from my asset column of S\"J,000 a month.\nAnd I have monthly expenses of 52,000. What is my wealth?\n  \nLet's go back to Buckminster Fuller's definition. Using his definition, how many days forward\ncan I survive? And let's assume a 30-day month. By that definition, I have enough cash flow for\nhalf a month.\n  \nWhen I have achieved $2,000 a month cash flow from my assets, then I will be wealthy.\n  \nSo I am not yet rich, but I am wealthy. I now have income generated from assets each month\nthat fully cover my monthly expenses. If I want to increase my expenses, I first must increase my\ncash flow from assets to maintain this level of wealth. Take notice that it is at this point that I no\nlonger am dependent on my wages. I have focused on and been successful in building an asset\ncolumn that has made me financially independent. If I quit my job today, I would be able to\ncover my monthly expenses with the cash flow from my assets.\n  \nMy next goal would be to have the excess cash flow from my assets reinvested into the asset\ncolumn. The more money that goes into my asset column, the more my asset column grows.\nThe more my assets grow, the more my cash flow grows. And as long as I keep my expenses\nless than the cash flow from these assets, I will grow richer, with more and more income from\nsources other than my physical labor.\n  \nAs this reinvestment process continues, I am well on my way to being rich. The actual definition\nof rich is in the eye of the beholder. You can never be too rich.\n  \nJust remember this simple observation: The rich buy assets. The poor only have expenses. The\nmiddle class buys liabilities they think are assets.

Kiyosaki\n \nCHAPTER FOUR\n  Lesson Three: Mind Your Own Business\n  \nIn 1974, Ray Kroc, the founder of McDonald's, was asked to speak to the MBA class at the\nUniversity of Texas at Austin. A dear friend of mine, Keith Cunningham, was a student in that\nMBA class. After a powerful and inspiring talk, the class adjourned and the students asked Ray if\nhe would join them at their favorite hangout to have a few beers. Ray graciously accepted.\n  \n\u201cWhat business am I in?\u201d Ray asked, once the group had all their beers in hand.\n  \n\u201cEveryone laughed,\u201d said Keith. \u201cMost of the MBA students thought Ray was just fooling\naround.\u201d\n  \nNo one answered, so Ray asked the question again. \u201cWhat business do you think I'm in?\u201d\n  \nThe students laughed again, and finally one brave soul yelled out, \u201cRay, who in the world does\nnot know that you're in the hamburger business.\u201d\n  \nRay chuckled. \u201cThat is what I thought you would say.\u201d He paused and then quickly said, 'ladies\nand gentlemen, I'm not in the hamburger business. My business is real estate.\"\n  \nKeith said that Ray spent a good amount of time explaining his viewpoint. In their business plan,\nRay knew that the primary business focus was to sell hamburger franchises, but what he never\nlost sight of was the location of each franchise. He knew that the real estate and its location was\nthe most significant factor in the success of each franchise. Basically, the person that bought the\nfranchise was also paying for, buying, the land under the franchise for Ray Kroc's organization.\n  \nMcDonald's today is the largest single owner of real estate in the world, owning even more than\nthe Catholic Church. Today, McDonald's owns some of the most valuable intersections and\nstreet corners in America, as well as in other parts of the world.\n  \nKeith said it was one of the most important lessons in his life. Today, Keith owns car washes,\nbut his business is the real estate under those car washes.\n  \nThe previous chapter ended with the diagrams illustrating that most people work for everyone\nelse but themselves. They work first for the owners of the company, then for the government\nthrough taxes, and finally for the bank that owns their mortgage.\n  \nAs a young boy, we did not have a McDonald's nearby. Yet, my rich dad was responsible for\nteaching Mike and me the same lesson that Ray Kroc talked about at the University of Texas. It\nis secret No. 3 of the rich.\n  \nThe secret is: \"Mind your own business/' Financial struggle is often directly the result of people\nworking all their life for someone else. Many people will have nothing at the end of their\nworking days.\n  \nAgain, a picture is worth a thousand words. Here is a diagram of the income statement and\nPage 54/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2767, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cbdfbb0b-e686-406f-b556-f36ca07da3f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "cbdfbb0b-e686-406f-b556-f36ca07da3f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "14e2355f-f287-4a7d-a912-409dd2041ade", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "1658b28031c4ce904dd2400e9ffcd9a895b662524a424652e460b98a46d8ffbd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "dd8dc419-9a04-48c3-ba7b-4647278308f9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "b4a220282c22391022e2d8af68dd7d3d239835d63c9d445c2e5f225ee4e0fd71", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4c0fdb7b-7da6-4651-8317-f70214b76db9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bc20de1d521e9c7b8d83f02f0abfbaa1286390890a64229d18c907941c47de55", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "c372b35e4483e3721b6896cdae235720bb494ab5dc24f73db6a8576ec44ab1b8", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T. Kiyosaki\nbalance sheet that best describes Ray Kroc's advice:\n  \nMost people\n  \nYour Profession -> Your Income\n  \nThe Rich\n  \nYour Assets -> Your Income\n  \nOur current educational system focuses on preparing today's youth to get good jobs by\ndeveloping scholastic skills. Their lives will revolve around their wages, or as described earlier,\ntheir income column. And after developing scholastic skills, they go on to higher levels of\nschooling to enhance their professional abilities. They study to become engineers, scientists,\ncooks, police officers, artists, writers and so on. These professional skills allow them to enter the\nworkforce and work for money.\n  \nThere is a big difference between your profession and your business. Often I ask people, \u201cWhat\nis your business?\u201d And they will say, \u201cOh I'm a banker.\u201d Then I ask them if they own the bank?\nAnd they usually respond. \u201cNo, I work there.\u201d\n  \nIn that instance, they have confused their profession with their business. Their profession may\nbe a banker, but they still need their own business. Ray Kroc was clear on the difference\nbetween his profession and his business. His profession was always the same. Me was a\nsalesman. At one time he sold mixers for milkshakes, and soon thereafter he was selling\nhamburger franchises- But while his profession was selling hamburger franchises, his business\nwas the accumulation of income-producing real estate.\n  \nA problem with school is that you often become what you study. So if you study, say, cooking,\nyou become a chef. If you study the law, you become an attorney, and a study of auto\nmechanics makes you a mechanic. The mistake in becoming what you study is that too many\npeople forget to mind their own business. They spend their lives minding someone else's\nbusiness and making that person rich.\n  \nTo become financially secure, a person needs to mind their own business. Your business\nrevolves around your asset column, as opposed to your income column. As stated earlier, the\nNo. 1 rule is to know the difference between an asset and a liability, and to buy assets. The rich\nfocus on their asset columns while everyone else focuses on their income statements.\n  \nThat is why we hear so often: \u201cI need a raise.\u201d \u201cIf only I had a promotion.\u201d \u201cI am going to go\nback to school to get more training so I can get a better job.\u201d \u201cI am going to work overtime.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe I can get a second job.\u201d \u201cI'm quitting in two weeks. I found a job that pays more.\u201d\n  \nIn some circles, these are sensible ideas. Yet, if you listen to Ray Kroc, you are still not minding\nyour own business. These ideas all still focus on the income column and will only help a person\nbecome more financially secure if the additional money is used to purchase income-generating\nassets.\n  \nThe primary reason the majority of the poor and middle class are fiscally conservative-which\nmeans. \u201cI can't afford to take risks\u201d-is that they have no financial foundation. They have to cling\nPage 55/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3013, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4c0fdb7b-7da6-4651-8317-f70214b76db9": {"__data__": {"id_": "4c0fdb7b-7da6-4651-8317-f70214b76db9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "244425e8-d908-4288-b2e7-19d5434016ab", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "b650314c19850e0ae7f3bef6eaec2329bebc9f1030c92694463547336b226807", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cbdfbb0b-e686-406f-b556-f36ca07da3f5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "c372b35e4483e3721b6896cdae235720bb494ab5dc24f73db6a8576ec44ab1b8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e6a3e9ee-2f19-444c-a36a-36bff610770f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3f83838a4d6f9cd11ad72a34757eb8affbc617b89b021ee311f649c9ee5daf1b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "bc20de1d521e9c7b8d83f02f0abfbaa1286390890a64229d18c907941c47de55", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T.

They have to play it safe.\n  \nWhen downsizing became the \u201cin\u201d thing lo do, millions of workers | found out their largest so-\ncalled asset, their home, was eating them alive, j Their asset, called a house, still cost them\nmoney every month. Their car, another \u201casset,\u201d was eating them alive. The golf clubs in the\ngarage that cost $1,000 were not worth 51,000 anymore. Without job security, they had\nnothing to fall back on. What they thought were assets could not help them survive in a time of\nfinancial crisis.\n  \n1 assume most of us have filled out a credit application for a banker to buy a house or to buy a\ncar. It is always interesting to look at the \"net worth'1 section. It is interesting because of what\naccepted banking and accounting practices allow a person to count as assets.\n  \nOne day, to get a loan, my financial position did not look too good. So I added my new golf\nclubs, my art collection, books, stereo, television, Armani suits, wristwatches, shoes and other\npersonal effects to boost the number in the asset column.\n  \nBut I was turned down for the loan because I had too much investment real estate. The loan\ncommittee did not like that 1 made so much money off of apartment houses. They wanted to\nknow why I did not have a normal job, with a salary. They did not question the Armani suits, golf\nclubs or art collection. Life is sometimes tough when you do not fit the \u201cstandard\u201d profile.\n  \nI cringe every time I hear someone say to me that their net worth is a million dollars or\n$100,000 dollars or whatever. One of the main reasons net worth is not accurate is simply\nbecause the moment you begin selling your assets, you are taxed for any gains.\n  \nSo many people have put themselves in deep financial trouble when they run short of income.\nTo raise cash, they sell their assets. First, their personal assets can generally be sold for only a\nfraction of the value that is listed in their personal balance sheet. Or if there is a gain on the sale\nof the assets, they are taxed on the gain. So again, the government takes its share of the gain,\nthus reducing the amount available to help them out\n  \nOf debt. That is why I say someone's net worth is often \u201cworth less\u201d than they think.\n  \nStart minding your own business. Keep your daytime job, but start buying real assets, not\nliabilities or personal effects that have no real value once you get them home. A new car loses\nnearly 25 percent of the price you pay for it the moment you drive it off the lot. It is not a true\nasset even if your banker lets you list it as one. My $400 new titanium driver was worth S150\nthe moment I teed off.\n  \nFor adults, keep your expenses low, reduce your liabilities and diligently build a base of solid\nassets. For young people who have not yet left home, it is important for parents to teach them\nthe difference between an asset and a liability. Get them to start building a solid asset column\nbefore they leave home, get married, buy a house, have kids and get stuck in a risky financial\nposition, clinging to a job and buying everything on credit. I see so many young couples who get\nmarried and trap themselves into a lifestyle that will not let them get out of debt for most of their\nworking years.\n  \nFor most people, just as the last child leaves home, the parents realize they have not adequately\nPage 56/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3406, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e6a3e9ee-2f19-444c-a36a-36bff610770f": {"__data__": {"id_": "e6a3e9ee-2f19-444c-a36a-36bff610770f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c7009076-5130-4aed-9c46-e42cb0bf2421", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "72ccd06e386d59c7118bb0362d595d337c12849476c809814048bef5c1158f46", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4c0fdb7b-7da6-4651-8317-f70214b76db9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "bc20de1d521e9c7b8d83f02f0abfbaa1286390890a64229d18c907941c47de55", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ba40f2cd-6919-4470-8787-551dec659d01", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7ef81e11712379ca790377d4b4ad4a3916b6daa8c555c05a599190b732210d00", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "3f83838a4d6f9cd11ad72a34757eb8affbc617b89b021ee311f649c9ee5daf1b", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T.

Royalties from intellectual property such as music, scripts, patents.\n  \n8. And anything else that has value, produces income or appreciates and has a ready market.\n  \nAs a young boy, my educated dad encouraged me to find a safe job. My rich dad, on the other\nhand, encouraged me to begin acquiring assets that I loved. \u201cIf you don't love it, you won't take\ncare of it.\u201d I collect real estate simply because I love buildings and land. I love shopping for\nthem. 1 could look at them all day long. When problems arise, the problems are not so bad that\nit changes my love for real estate. For people who hate real estate, they shouldn't buy it.\n  \nI love stocks of small companies, especially startups. The reason is that I am an entrepreneur,\nnot a corporate person. In my early years. I worked in large organizations, such as Standard Oil\nof California, the U.S. Marine Corps, and Xerox Corp. I enjoyed my time with those\norganizations and have fond memories, but I know deep down I am not a company man. I like\nstarting companies, not running them. So my slock buys are usually of small companies, and\nsometimes I even start the company and take it public. Fortunes are made in new-stock issues,\nand I love the game. Many people are afraid of small-cap companies and call them risky, and\nthey are. But risk is always diminished if you love what the investment is, understand it and\nknow the game. With small companies, my investment strategy is to be out of the stock in a\nyear. My real estate strategy, on the other hand, is to start small and keep trading the properties\nup for bigger properties and, therefore, delaying paying taxes on the gain. This allows the value\nto increase dramatically. I generally hold real estate less than seven years.\n  \nFor years, even while I was with the Marine Corps and Xerox, I did what my rich dad\nrecommended. I kept my daytime job, but I still minded my own business. I was active in my\nasset column. I traded real estate and small stocks. Rich dad always stressed the importance of\nfinancial literacy. The better I was at understanding the accounting and cash management, the\nbetter I would be at analyzing investments and eventually starting and building my own company.\n  \nI would not encourage anyone to start a company unless they really want to. Knowing what I\nknow about running a company, I would not wish that task on anyone.

Of those that survive the first five\nyears, nine out of every 10 of those eventually fail, as well. So only if you really have the desire\nto own your own company do I recommend it. Otherwise, keep your daytime job and mind your\nown business. When I say mind your own business, 1 mean to build and keep your asset column\nstrong. Once a dollar goes into it, never let it come out. Think of it this way, once a dollar goes\ninto your asset column, it becomes your employee. The best thing about money is that it works\n24 hours a day and can work for generations. Keep your daytime job, be a great hard-working\nemployee, but keep building that asset column.\n  \nAs your cash flow grows, you can buy some luxuries. An important distinction is that rich people\nbuy luxuries last, while the poor and middle class tend to buy luxuries first. The poor and the\nmiddle class often buy luxury items such as big houses, diamonds, furs, jewelry or boats because\nthey want to look rich. They look rich, but in reality they just get deeper in debt on credit. The\nold-money people, the long-term rich, built their asset column first. Then, the income generated\nfrom the asset column bought their luxuries. The poor and middle class buy luxuries with their\nown sweat, blood and children's inheritance.\n  \nA true luxury is a reward for investing in and developing a real asset. For example, when my\nwife and I had extra money coming from our apartment houses, she went out and bought her\nMercedes. It did not take any extra work or risk on her part because the apartment house\nbought the car. She did, however, have to wait for it for four years while the real estate\ninvestment portfolio grew and finally began throwing off enough extra cash flow to pay for the\ncar. But the luxury, the Mercedes, was a true reward because she had proved she knew how to\ngrow her asset column. That car now means a lot more to her than simply another pretty car. It\nmeans she used her financial intelligence to afford it.\n  \nWhat most people do is they impulsively go out and buy a new car, or some other luxury, on\ncredit. They may feel bored and just want a new toy. Buying a luxury on credit often causes a\nperson to sooner or later actually resent that luxury because the debt on the luxury becomes a\nfinancial burden.\n  \nAfter you've taken the time and invested in and built your own business, you are now ready to\nadd the magic touch-the biggest secret of the rich. The secret that puts the rich way ahead of\nthe pack. The reward at the end of the road for diligently taking the time to mind your own\nbusiness.\n \nPage 58/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2805, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "008d70ee-6c99-4cb5-93ca-c7e946ce0e10": {"__data__": {"id_": "008d70ee-6c99-4cb5-93ca-c7e946ce0e10", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "40d157fa-12f2-4b72-9958-65bfae5675a8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "8602eee679b4e58bb08daedb8752944b43c79b269d343fabc85dbb5ef00a3f2b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ba40f2cd-6919-4470-8787-551dec659d01", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "7ef81e11712379ca790377d4b4ad4a3916b6daa8c555c05a599190b732210d00", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "143c30c6-cc1e-4e36-acb7-63e7e346722d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5d112759515795e0c2b5e69bb16158c772b22483d407a332317c71da750b0af4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e077a7b8dd99fcebe9d59d5f241d085b8c7b5e03b42f4839eb038b0b50132b6a", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T. Kiyosaki\n \nCHAPTER FIVE\n  Lesson Four:The History of and The Power of Corporation\n  \nI remember in school being told the story of Robin Hood and his Merry Men. My schoolteacher\nthought it was a wonderful story of a romantic hero, a Kevin Costner type, who robbed from the\nrich and gave to the poor. My rich dad did not see Robin Hood as a hero. He called Robin Hood\na crook.\n  \nRobin Hood may be long gone, but his followers live on. How often I still hear people say, \u201cWhy\ndon't the rich pay for it?\u201d Or \u201cThe rich should pay more in taxes and give it to the poor.\u201d\n  \nIt is this idea of Robin Hood, or taking from the rich to give to the poor that has caused the\nmost pain for the poor and the middle class. The reason the middle class is so heavily taxed is\nbecause of the Robin Hood ideal. The real reality is that the rich are not taxed. It's the middle\nclass who pays for the poor, especially the educated upper-income middle class.\n  \nAgain, to understand fully how things happen, we need to look at the historical perspective. We\nneed to look at the history of taxes. Although my highly educated dad was an expert on the\nhistory of education, my rich dad fashioned himself as an expert on the history of taxes.\n  \nRich dad explained to Mike and me that in England and America originally, there were no taxes.\nOccasionally there were temporary taxes levied in order to pay for wars. The king or the\npresident would put the word out and ask everyone to \u201cchip in.\u201d Taxes were levied in Britain for\nthe fight against Napoleon from 1799 to 1816, and in America taxes were levied to pay for the\nCivil War from 1861 to 1865.\n  \nIn 1874, England made income tax a permanent levy on its citizens. In 1913, an income tax\nbecame permanent in the United States with the adoption of the 16th Amendment to the\nConstitution. At one time, Americans were anti-tax. It had been the excessive tax on tea that led\nto the famous Tea Party in Boston Harbor, an incident that helped ignite the Revolutionary\nWar. It took approximately 50 years in both England and '\u2022 the United States to sell the idea of a\nregular income tax. ;\n  \nWhat these historical dates fail to reveal is that both of these taxes were initially levied against\nonly the rich. It was this point that rich dad wanted Mike and me to understand. He explained\nthat the idea of taxes was made popular, and accepted by the majority, by telling the poor and\nthe middle class that taxes were created only to punish the rich. This is how the masses voted\nfor the law, and it became constitutionally legal. Although it was intended to punish the rich, in\nreality it wound up punishing the very people who voted for it, the poor and middle class.\n  \n\u201cOnce government got a taste of money, the appetite grew,\u201d said rich dad. \u201cYour dad and I are\nexactly opposite. He's a government bureaucrat, and I am a capitalist. We get paid, and our\nsuccess is measured on opposite behaviors. He gets paid to spend money and hire people. The\nmore he spends and the more people he hires, the larger his organization becomes. In the\ngovernment, the larger his organization, the more he is respected.

They have different objectives from\nmost business people. As the government grows, more and more tax dollars will be needed to\nsupport it.\u201d\n  \nMy educated dad sincerely believed that government should help\n  \npeople. He loved John F. Kennedy and especially the idea of the Peace Corps. He loved the\nidea so much that both he and my mom worked for the Peace Corps training volunteers to go to\nMalaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. He always strived for additional grants and increases in\nhis budget so he could hire more people, both in his job with the Education Department and in\nthe Peace Corps. That was his job.\n  \nFrom the time I was about 10 years old, I would hear from my rich dad that government workers\nwere a pack of lazy thieves, and from my poor dad I would hear how the rich were greedy\ncrooks who should be made to pay more taxes. Both sides have valid points. It was difficult to go\nto work for one of the biggest capitalists in town and come home to a father who was a\nprominent government leader. It was not easy knowing who to believe.\n  \nYet, when you study the history of taxes, an interesting perspective emerges. As I said, the\npassage of taxes was only possible because the masses believed in the Robin Hood theory of\neconomics, which was to take from the rich and give to everyone else. The problem was that\nthe government's appetite for money was so great that taxes soon needed to be levied on the\nmiddle class, and from there it kept \u201ctrickling down.\u201d\n  \nThe rich, on the other hand, saw an opportunity. They do not play by the same set of rules. As\nI've stated, the rich already knew about corporations, which became popular in the days of\nsailing ships. The rich created the corporation as a vehicle to limit their risk to the assets of each\nvoyage. The rich put their money into a corporation to finance the voyage. The corporation\nwould then hire a crew to sail to the New World to look for treasures. If the ship was lost, the\ncrew lost their lives, but the loss to the rich would be limited only to the money they invested for\nthat particular voyage. The diagram that follows shows how the corporate structure sits outside\nyour personal income statement and balance sheet.\n  \nHow the Rich Play the Game\n  \nIs reduced/diminished by expenses Assets ------------------------------------------------> Income (through\npersonal corporation)\n  \nIt is the knowledge of the power of the legal structure of the corporation that really gives the\nrich a vast advantage over the poor and the middle class. Having two fathers teaching me, one a\nsocialist and the other a capitalist, I quickly began to realize that the philosophy of the capitalist\nmade more financial sense to me. It seemed to me that the socialists ultimately penalized\nthemselves, due to their lack of financial education. No matter what the \u201cTake from the rich\u201d\ncrowd came up with, the rich always found a way to outsmart them. That is how taxes were\neventually levied on the middle class. The rich outsmarted the intellectuals, solely because they\nunderstood the power of money, a subject not taught in schools.\n  \nHow did the rich outsmart the intellectuals? Once the \u201cTake from the rich\u201d tax was passed, cash\nPage 60/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3425, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "350ba796-872a-46dd-876e-dae311859e2e": {"__data__": {"id_": "350ba796-872a-46dd-876e-dae311859e2e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7d1e7360-b780-4a61-b782-7fbeb81af3ce", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "c3d924414d8f738bb7385163e0bd8748314da862887cb2fcdb4746a2158bdd8d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "143c30c6-cc1e-4e36-acb7-63e7e346722d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "60", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "5d112759515795e0c2b5e69bb16158c772b22483d407a332317c71da750b0af4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f372dd75-bc69-449f-b0d8-cab76d6ab15a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7c27fdd423ce8aabd577beeda8f8696592ec5d99e100c6a66136192fe2d23f51", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "b0e71051872ed5e58f03ed9aa09990d31721271e775314d08164a5f476a927d6", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T. Kiyosaki\nstarted flowing into government coffers. Initially, people were happy. Money was handed out to\ngovernment workers and the rich. It went to government workers in the form of jobs and\npensions. It went to the rich via their factories receiving government contracts. The government\nbecame a large pool of money, but the problem was the fiscal management of that money.\nThere really is no recirculation. In other words, the government policy, if you were a\ngovernment bureaucrat, was to avoid having excess money. If you failed to spend your allotted\nfunding, you risked losing it in the next budget.\n  \nYou would certainly not be recognized for being efficient. Business people, on the other hand,\nare rewarded for having excess money and are recognized for their efficiency.\n  \nAs this cycle of growing government spending continued, the demand for money increased and\nthe \u201cTax the rich\u201d idea was now being adjusted to include lower-income levels, down to the very\npeople who voted it in, the poor and the middle class.\n  \nTrue capitalists used their financial knowledge to simply find a way to escape. They headed back\nto the protection of a corporation. A corporation protects the rich. But what many people who\nhave never formed a corporation do not know is that a corporation is not really a thing. A\ncorporation is merely a file folder with some legal documents in it, sitting in some attorney's\noffice registered with a state government agency. It's not a big building with the name of the\ncorporation on it. It's not a factory or a group of people. A corporation is merely a legal\ndocument that creates a legal body without a soul. The wealth of the rich was once again\nprotected. Once again, the use of corporations became popular-once the permanent income\nlaws were passed- because the income-tax rate of the corporation was less than the individual\nincome-tax rates. In addition, as described earlier, certain expenses could be paid with pre-tax\ndollars within the corporation.\n  \nThis war between the haves and have-nots has been going on for hundreds of years. It is the\n\u201cTake from the rich\u201d crowd versus the rich. The battle is waged whenever and wherever laws\nare made. The battle will go on forever. The problem is, the people who lose are the\nuninformed. The ones who get up every day and diligently go to work and pay taxes. If they\nonly understood the way the rich play the game, they could play it too. Then, they would be on\ntheir way to their own financial independence.

An employee with a\nsafe, secure job, without financial aptitude, has no escape.\n  \nAverage Americans today work five to six months for the government before they make enough\nto cover their taxes.

Kiyosaki\nThe Tax Code of the United States also allows other ways to save on taxes. Most of these\nvehicles are available to anyone, but it is the rich who usually look for them because they are\nminding their own business. For example, \u201c1031\u201d is jargon for Section 1031 of the Internal\nRevenue Code, which allows a seller to delay paying taxes on a piece of real estate; that is sold\nfor a capital gain through an exchange for a more expensive piece of real estate. Real estate is\none investment vehicle that allows such a great tax advantage. As long as you keep trading up in\nvalue, you I will not be taxed on the gains, until you liquidate. People who do not take advantage\nof these tax savings offered legally are missing a great opportunity to build their asset columns.\n  \nThe poor and middle class do not have the same resources. They sit there and let the\ngovernment's needles enter their arm and allow the blood donation to begin. Today, I am\nconstantly shocked at the number of people who pay more taxes, or take fewer deductions,\nsimply because they are afraid of the government. And I do know how frightening and\nintimidating a government tax agent can be. I have had friends who have had their businesses\nshut down and destroyed, only to find out it was a mistake on the part of the government. I\nrealize all that. But the price of working from January to mid-May is a high price to pay for that\nintimidation. My poor dad never fought back. My rich dad didn't either. He just played the game\nsmarter, and he did it through corporations-the biggest secret of the rich.\n  \nYou may remember the first lesson I learned from my rich dad. I was a little boy of 9 who had to\nsit and wait for him to choose to talk to me. I often sat in his office waiting for him to \u201cget to\nme.\u201d He was ignoring me on purpose. He wanted me to recognize his power and desire to\nhave that power for myself one day. For all the years I studied J and learned from him, he\nalways reminded me that knowledge was power. And with money comes great power that\nrequires the right knowledge to keep it and make it multiply. Without that knowledge, the world\npushes you around. Rich dad constantly reminded Mike and me that the biggest bully was not\nthe boss or the supervisor, but the tax man. The tax man will always take more if you let him.\n  \nThe first lesson of having money work for me, as opposed to working for money, is really all\nabout power. If you work for money, you give the power up to your employer. If your money\nworks for you, you keep and control the power.\n  \nOnce we had this knowledge of the power of money working for us, he wanted us to be\nfinancially smart and not let bullies push us around. You need to know the law and how the\nsystem works. If you're ignorant, it is easy to be bullied. If you know what you're talking about,\nyou have a fighting chance. That is why he paid so much for smart tax accountants and\nattorneys. It was less expensive to pay them than pay the government. His best lesson to me,\nwhich I have used most of my life, is \u201cBe smart and you won't be pushed around as much.\u201d He\nknew the law because he was a law-abiding citizen. He knew the law because it was expensive\nto not know the law. \u201cIf you know you're right, you're not afraid of fighting back.\u201d Even if you\nare taking on Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men.\n  \nMy highly educated dad always encouraged me to seek a good job with a strong corporation. He\nspoke of the virtues of \u201cworking your way up the corporate ladder.\u201d He didn't understand that,\nby relying solely on a paycheck from a corporate employer, I would be a docile cow ready for\nmilking.\n  \nWhen I told my rich dad of my father's advice, he only chuckled. \u201cWhy not own the ladder?\u201d\nPage 62/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3789, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cbb1df26-0508-4601-91ed-2e7e6f3b7b6f": {"__data__": {"id_": "cbb1df26-0508-4601-91ed-2e7e6f3b7b6f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "63", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8198ad2b-fb62-40ef-93ec-8f17b96a3e9a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "63", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "796ad2e4daf6fe0d86408ae6feaa9581467d76d182c4644a8e54d4edcc2123f5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f372dd75-bc69-449f-b0d8-cab76d6ab15a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "7c27fdd423ce8aabd577beeda8f8696592ec5d99e100c6a66136192fe2d23f51", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5ad9f9c5-f995-4fed-9bd3-83aba8c6fbbe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0965e688c02d39b722209415106480f7aa7efd752ff5c6d13d1c22f995196e6a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "bd53bb79caefe04e867cef43c29ae213fbe69bc234f2a8cc417fbc0c5377a9ff", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T. Kiyosaki\nwas all he said.\n  \nAs a young boy, I did not understand what rich dad meant by owning my own corporation. It\nwas an idea that seemed impossible, and intimidating. Although I was excited by the idea, my\nyouth would not let me envision the possibility that grownups would someday work for a\ncompany I would own.\n  \nThe point is, if not for my rich dad, I would have probably followed my educated dad's advice. It\nwas merely the occasional reminder of my rich dad that kept the idea of owning my own\ncorporation alive and kept me on a different path. By the time I was 15 or 16, I knew I was not\ngoing to continue down the path my educated dad was recommending. I did not know how I was\ngoing to do it, but I was determined not to head in the direction most of my classmates were\nheading. That decision changed my life.\n  \nIt was not until I was in my mid-20s that my rich dad's advice began to make more sense. I was\njust out of the Marine Corps and working for Xerox. I was making a lot of money, but every\ntime I looked at my paycheck, I was always disappointed. The deductions were so large, and the\nmore I worked, the greater the deductions. As I became more successful, my bosses talked\nabout promotions and raises. It was flattering, but I could hear my rich dad asking me in my ear:\n\u201cWho are you working for? Who are you making rich?\u201d\n  \nIn 1974, while still an employee for Xerox, I formed my first corporation and began \u201cminding\nmy own business.\u201d There were already a few assets in my asset column, but now I was\ndetermined to focus on making it bigger. Those paychecks with all the deductions made all the\nyears of my rich dad's advice make total sense. I could see the future if I followed my educated\ndad's advice.\n  \nMany employers feel that advising their workers to mind their own business is bad for business. I\nam sure it can be for certain individuals. But for me, focusing on my own business, developing\nassets, made me a better employee. I now had a purpose. I came in early and worked diligently,\namassing as much money as possible so I could begin investing in real estate. Hawaii was just set\nto boom, and there were 4 fortunes to be made. The more I realized we were in the beginning\nstages of a boom, the more Xerox machines I sold. The more I sold, the more money I made,\nand, of course, the more deductions there were from my paycheck. It was inspiring. I wanted\nout of the trap of being an employee so badly that I worked harder, not less. By 1978,I was\nconsistently one of the top five salespeople in sales, often No. 1. I badly wanted out of the rat\nrace.\n  \nIn less than three years, I was making more in my own little corporation, which was a real estate\nholding company, than I was making at Xerox. And the money I was making in my asset\ncolumn, in my own corporation, was money working for me. Not me pounding on doors selling\ncopiers. My rich dad's advice made much more sense. Soon the cash flow from my properties\nwas so strong that my company bought me my first Porsche. My fellow Xerox salespeople\nthought I was spending my commissions. I wasn't. I was investing my commissions in assets.\n  \nMy money was working hard to make more money. Each dollar in my asset column was a great\nemployee, working hard to make more employees and buy the boss a new Porsche with before-\ntax dollars. I began to work harder for Xerox.

It was made possible because of the strong financial\nknowledge I had acquired through these lessons. Without this financial knowledge, which I call\nfinancial IQ, my road to financial independence would have been much more difficult. I now\nteach others through financial seminars in the hope that I may share my knowledge with them.\nWhenever I do my talks, I remind people that financial IQ is made up of knowledge from four\nbroad areas of expertise.\n  \nNo. 1 is accounting. What I call financial literacy. A vital skill if you want to build an empire. The\nmore money you are responsible for, the more accuracy is required, or the house comes\ntumbling down. This is the left brain side, or the details. Financial literacy is the ability to read\nand understand financial statements. This ability allows you to identify the strengths and\nweaknesses of any business.\n  \nNo. 2 is investing. What I call the science of money making money. This involves strategies and\nformulas. This is the right brain side, or the creative side.\n  \nNo. 3 is understanding markets. The science of supply and demand. There is a need to know\nthe \u201ctechnical\u201d aspects of the market, which is emotion driven; the Tickle Me Elmo doll during\nChristmas 1996 is a case of a technical or emotion-driven market. The other market factor is\nthe \u201cfundamental\u201d or the economic sense of an investment. Does an investment make sense or\ndoes it not make sense based on the current market conditions.\n  \nMany people think the concepts of investing and understanding the market are too complex for\nkids. They fail to see that kids know those subjects intuitively. For those not familiar with the\nElmo doll, it was a Sesame Street character that was highly touted to the kids just before\nChristmas. Most all kids wanted one, and put it at the top of their Christmas list. Many parents\nwondered if the company intentionally held the product off the market, while continuing to\nadvertise it for Christmas. A panic set in due to high demand and lack of supply. Having no dolls\nto buy in the stores, scalpers saw an opportunity to make a small fortune from desperate\nparents. The unlucky parents who did not find a doll were forced to buy another toy for\nChristmas. The incredible popularity of the Tickle Me Elmo doll made no sense to me, but it\nserves as an excellent example of supply and demand economics. The same thing goes on in\nthe stock, bond, real estate and baseball-card markets.\n  \nNo. 4 is the law. For instance, utilizing a corporation wrapped around the technical skills of\naccounting, investing and markets can aid explosive growth. An individual with the knowledge of\nthe tax advantages and protection provided by a corporation can get rich so much faster than\nsomeone who is an employee or a small-business sole proprietor. It's like the difference\nbetween someone walking and someone flying. The difference is profound when it comes to\nlong-term wealth.\n  \n1. Tax advantages: A corporation can do so many things that an individual cannot. Like pay for\nexpenses before it pays taxes. That is a whole area of expertise that is so exciting, but not\nnecessary to get into unless you have sizable assets or a business. Employees earn and get taxed\nand they try to live on what is left. A corporation earns, spends everything it can, and is taxed\nPage 64/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3529, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "772d3791-c5ea-4840-a104-b08d79e24e65": {"__data__": {"id_": "772d3791-c5ea-4840-a104-b08d79e24e65", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "65", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8c032ad5-1291-4e7f-8f0f-5ba9a2510a0c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "65", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "cea58f4bee7c94b29610cd84ad018cdf0f5db39ed354d074fe3989e7055aa65b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5ad9f9c5-f995-4fed-9bd3-83aba8c6fbbe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "0965e688c02d39b722209415106480f7aa7efd752ff5c6d13d1c22f995196e6a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "36355879-19eb-46ea-b84e-bbd3b54138b8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5e6c4479e820a92285d53b3630ea2f73701eff588fe8142945abb098d959f737", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "f27e2f389fb8195c15e66bf970ed8e401c8001356c72badad0acbad0c17bc8ca", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T.

They're easy\nto set up and are not expensive if you own investments that are producing good cash flow. For\nexample; by owning your own corporation - vacations are board meetings in Hawaii. Car\npayments, insurance, repairs are company expenses. Health club membership is a company\nexpense. Most restaurant meals are partial expenses. And on and on - but do it legally with pre-\ntax dollars.\n  \n2. Protection from lawsuits. We live in a litigious society. Everybody wants a piece of your\naction. The rich hide much of their wealth using vehicles such as corporations and trusts to\nprotect their assets from creditors. When someone sues a wealthy individual they are often met\nwith layers of legal protection, and often find that the wealthy person actually owns nothing.\nThey control everything, but own nothing. The poor and middle class try to own everything and\nlose it to the government or to fellow citizens who like to sue the rich. They learned it from the\nRobin Hood story.

Kiyosaki\n \nCHAPTER SIX\n  Lesson Five:The Rich Invent Money\n  \nLast night, I took a break from writing and watched a TV program on the history of a young\nman named Alexander Graham Bell. Bell had just patented his telephone, and was having\ngrowing pains because the demand for his new invention was so strong. Needing a bigger\ncompany, he then went to the giant at that time, Western Union, and asked them if they would\nbuy his patent and his tiny company. He wanted $100,000 for the whole package. The\npresident of Western Union scoffed at him and turned him down, saying the price was\nridiculous. The rest is history. A multi-billion-dollar industry emerged, and AT&T was born.\n  \nThe evening news came on right after the story of Alexander Graham Bell ended. On the news\nwas a story of another downsizing at a local company. The workers were angry and complained\nthat the company ownership was unfair. A terminated manager of about 45 years of age had his\nwife and two babies at the plant and was begging the guards to let him talk to the owners to ask\nif they would reconsider his termination. He had just bought a house and was afraid of losing it.\nThe camera focused in on his pleading for all the world to see. Needless to say, it held my\nattention.\n  \nI have been teaching professionally since 1984. It has been a great experience and rewarding. It\nis also a disturbing profession, for I have\n  \ntaught thousands of individuals and I see one thing in common in all of us, myself included. We\nall have tremendous potential, and we all are blessed with gifts. Yet, the one thing that holds all\nof us back is some degree of self-doubt. It is not so much the lack of technical information that\nholds us back, but more the lack of self-confidence. Some are more affected than others.\n  \nOnce we leave school, most of us know that it is not as much a matter of college degrees or\ngood grades that count. In the real world outside of academics, something more than just grades\nis required. I have heard it called \u201cguts,\u201d \u201cchutzpah,\u201d \u201cballs,\u201d \u201caudacity,\u201d \u201cbravado,\u201d \u201ccunning,\u201d\n\u201cdaring,\u201d \u201ctenacity\u201d and \u201cbrilliance.\u201d This factor, whatever it is labeled, ultimately decides one's\nfuture much more than school grades.\n  \nInside each of us is one of these brave, brilliant and daring characters. There is also the flip side\nof that character: people who could get down on their knees and beg if necessary. After a year\nin Vietnam, as a Marine Corps pilot, I intimately got to know both of those characters-inside of\nme. One is not better than the other.\n  \nYet, as a teacher, I recognized that it was excessive fear and self-doubt that were the greatest\ndetractors of personal genius. It broke my heart to see students know the answers, yet lack the\ncourage to act on the answer. Often in the real world, it's not the smart that get ahead but the\nbold.\n  \nIn my personal experience, your financial genius requires both technical knowledge as well as\ncourage. If fear is too strong, the genius is suppressed. In my classes I strongly urge students to\nPage 66/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3104, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e0ffbea7-2539-4e22-9392-b1710a3f2660": {"__data__": {"id_": "e0ffbea7-2539-4e22-9392-b1710a3f2660", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "32615690-21aa-473c-92d8-fa8c03b89063", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "17419c0a481b62910c89dbb6374ed44898655d31d80350081af4db9f89068347", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "36355879-19eb-46ea-b84e-bbd3b54138b8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "66", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "5e6c4479e820a92285d53b3630ea2f73701eff588fe8142945abb098d959f737", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ebbbac49-19ab-4b0e-becb-5b5ba6b15fdd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8fb12a956283ec1f8f56fe62f8dbb1645b24dfa037dbbe6e676679b25239cfd4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "a407dbc3d5e08c1052dffa33241587e551e45f46ee3f66d4950414d7cdecebb8", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T.

I have come to realize that for most people, when it\ncomes to the subject of money, they would rather play it safe. I have had to field questions such\nas: Why take risks? Why should I bother developing my financial IQ? Why should I become\nfinancially literate?\n  \nAnd I answer, \u201cJust to have more options.\u201d\n  \nThere are huge changes up head. Just as I started with the story of the young inventor\nAlexander Graham Bell, in the coming years there will be more people just like him. There will\nbe a hundred people like Bill Gates and hugely successful companies like Microsoft created\nevery year, all over the world. And there also will be many more bankruptcies, layoffs and\ndownsizing.\n  \nSo why bother developing your financial IQ? No one can answer that but you. Yet, I can tell you\nwhy I myself do it. I do it because it is the most exciting time to be alive. I'd rather be welcoming\nchange than dreading change. I'd rather be excited about making millions than worrying about\nnot getting a raise. This period we are in now is a most exciting time, unprecedented in our\nworld's history. Generations from now, people will look back at this period of time and remark\nat what an exciting era it must have been. It was the death of the old and birth of the new. It\nwas full of turmoil and it was exciting.\n  \nSo why bother developing your financial IQ? Because if you do, you will prosper greatly. And if\nyou don't, this period of time will be a frightening one. It will be a time of watching people\nmove boldly forward while others cling to decaying life rings.\n  \nLand was wealth 300 years ago. So the person who owned the land owned the wealth. Then, it\nwas factories and production, and America rose to dominance. The industrialist owned the\nwealth. Today, it is information. And the person who has the most timely information owns the\nwealth. The problem is, information flies all around the world at the speed of light. The new\nwealth cannot be contained by boundaries and borders as land and factories were. The changes\nwill be faster and more dramatic. There will be a dramatic increase in the number of new\nmultimillionaires. There also will be those who are left behind.\n  \nToday, I find so many people struggling, often working harder, simply because they cling to old\nideas. They want things to be the way they were; they resist change. I know people who are\nlosing their jobs or their houses, and they blame technology or the economy or their boss. Sadly\nthey fail to realize that they might be the problem. Old ideas are their biggest liability. It is a\nliability simply because they fail to realize that while that idea or way of doing something was an\nasset yesterday, yesterday is gone.\n  \nOne afternoon I was teaching investing using a board game I had invented, CASHFLOW, as a\nteaching tool. A friend had brought someone along to attend the class. This friend of a friend\nwas recently divorced, had been badly burned in the divorce settlement, and was now searching\nfor some answers. Her friend thought the class might help.\n  \nThe game was designed to help people learn how money works. In playing the game, they\nlearn about the interaction of the income statement with the balance sheet.

This\nwoman missed a valuable opportunity to learn something. In the opening round, she drew a\n\u201cdoodad\u201d card with the boat on it. At first she was happy. \u201cOh, I've got a boat.\u201d Then, as her\nfriend tried to explain how the numbers worked on her income statement and balance sheet,\nshe got frustrated because she \u201chad never liked math. The rest of her table waited while her\nfriend continued explaining the relationship between the income statement, balance sheet and\nmonthly cash flow. Suddenly, when she realized how the numbers worked, it dawned on her\nthat her boat was eating her alive. Later on in the game, she was also \u201ddownsized\" and had a\nchild. It was a horrible game for her.\n  \nAfter the class, her friend came by and told me that she was upset. She had come to the class to\nlearn about investing and did not like the idea that it took so long to play a silly game.\n  \nHer friend attempted to tell her to look within herself to see if the game \u201creflected\u201d on herself\nin any way. With that suggestion, the woman demanded her money back. She said that the very\nidea that a game could be a reflection of her was ridiculous. Her money was promptly refunded\nand she left.\n  \nSince 1984, I have made millions simply by doing what the school system does not. In school,\nmost teachers lecture. I hated lectures as a student; I was soon bored and my mind would drift.\n  \nIn 1984,I began teaching via games and simulations. I always encouraged adult students to look\nat games as reflecting back to what they know, and what they needed to learn. Most\nimportantly, a game reflects back on one's behavior. It's an instant feedback system. Instead of\nthe teacher lecturing you, the game is feeding back a personalized lecture, custom made just for\nyou.\n  \nThe friend of the woman who left later called to give me an update. She said her friend was fine\nand had calmed down. In her cooling-off period, she could see some slight relationship between\nthe game and her life.\n  \nAlthough she and her husband did not own a boat, they did own\n  \neverything else imaginable. She was angry after their divorce, both because he had run off with\na younger woman and because after twenty years of marriage, they had accumulated little in the\nway of assets. There was virtually nothing for them to split. Their twenty years of married life\nhad been incredible fun, but all they had accumulated was a ton of doodads.\n  \nShe realized that her anger at doing the numbers-the income statement and balance sheet-came\nfrom her embarrassment of not understanding them. She had believed that finances were the\nman's job. She maintained the house and did the entertaining, and he handled the finances. She\nwas now quite certain that in the last five years of their marriage, he had hidden money from\nher. She was angry at herself for not being more aware of where the money was going, as well\nas for not knowing about the other woman.\n  \nPage 68/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3335, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77475802-8c38-4854-b9d8-eba07d58eb53": {"__data__": {"id_": "77475802-8c38-4854-b9d8-eba07d58eb53", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "69", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "eae2057e-7d26-458d-8539-00d5b080e370", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "69", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "1e9459b12a5e64977ad3d1b89c39091e404865a48629528e75e14de550e40b17", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ebbbac49-19ab-4b0e-becb-5b5ba6b15fdd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "8fb12a956283ec1f8f56fe62f8dbb1645b24dfa037dbbe6e676679b25239cfd4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "96334abb-8cde-4326-bdfe-6b066be7f5e8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "03ec5a65030399b46aec8ac7f008fda86c25a9e207902b9b27603c628155c7b9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "91d06497b316e115942aa31a0acd2b3b0d81e2b88fa186791a0e3962b9c2c7d8", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T.

The young\nfemale reporter was on time, and the interview got under way immediately. We sat in the lobby\nof a luxurious hotel, sipping coffee and discussing the purpose of my visit to Singapore. I was to\nshare the platform with Zig Ziglar. He was speaking on motivation, and I was speaking on \u201cThe\nSecrets of the Rich.\u201d</p> <div class='story_text'>\u201cSomeday, I would like to be a best-selling\nauthor like you,\u201d she said. I had seen some of the articles she had written for the paper, and I\nwas impressed. She had a tough, clear style of writing. Her articles held a reader's interest.</p>\n<div class='story_text'>\u201cYou have a great style,\u201d I said in reply. \u201cWhat holds you back from\nachieving your dream?\u201d</p> <div class='story_text'>\u201cMy work does not seem to go anywhere,\u201d\nshe said quietly. \u201cEveryone says that my novels are excellent, but nothing happens. So I keep\nmy job with the paper. At least it pays the bills. Do you have any suggestions?\u201d</p> <div\nclass='story_text'>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d I said brightly. \u201cA friend of mine here in Singapore runs a school\nthat trains people to sell. He runs sales-training courses for many of the top corporations here in\nSingapore, and I think attending one of his courses would greatly enhance your career.\u201d</p>\n<div class='story_text'>She stiffened. \u201cAre you saying I should go to school to learn to\nsell?\u201d</p> <div class='story_text'>I nodded.</p> <div class='story_text'>\u201cYou aren't serious,\nare you?\u201d</p> <div class='story_text'>Again, I nodded. \u201cWhat is wrong with that?\u201d I was now\nbackpeddling. She was offended by something, and now I was wishing 11 had not said anything.\nIn my attempt to be helpful, I found myself defending my suggestion.</p> <div\nclass='story_text'>\u201cI have a master's degree in English Literature. Why would I go to school to\nlearn to be a salesperson? I am a professional. I went to school to be trained in a profession so I\nwould not have to be a salesperson. I hate salespeople. All they want is money. So tell me why|\nI should study sales?\u201d She was now packing her briefcase forcibly. The interview was over.</p>\n<div class='story_text'>On the coffee table sat a copy of an earlier best-selling book I wrote. I I\npicked it up as well as the notes she had jotted down on her legal pad. | \u201cDo you see this?\u201d I\nsaid pointing to her notes.</p> <div class='story_text'>She looked down at her notes. \u201cWhat,\u201d\nshe said, confused.</p> <div class='story_text'>Again, I pointed deliberately to her notes.

I was amazed.</p> <div class='story_text'>The sad\ntruth is, great talent is not enough.</p> <div class='story_text'>I am constantly shocked at how\nlittle talented people earn. I heard the other day that less than 5 percent of Americans earn\nmore than $100,000 a year. I have met brilliant, highly educated people who earn less than\n$20,000 a year. A business consultant who specializes in the medical trade was telling me how\nmany doctors, dentists and chiropractors struggle financially. All this time, I thought that when\nthey graduated, the dollars would pour in. It was this business consultant who gave me the\nphrase, \u201cThey are one skill away from great wealth.\u201d</p> <div class='story_text'>What this\nphrase means is that most people need only to learn and master one more skill and their\nincome would jump exponentially. I have mentioned before that financial intelligence is a\nsynergy of accounting, investing, marketing and law. Combine those four technical skills and\nmaking money with money is easier. When it comes to money, the only skill most people know\nis to work hard.</p> <div class='story_text'>The classic example of a synergy of skills was that\nyoung writer for the newspaper. If she diligently learned the skills of sales and marketing, her\nincome would jump dramatically. If I were her, I would take some courses in advertising\ncopywriting as well as sales. Then, instead of working at the newspaper, I would seek a job at an\nadvertising agency. Even if it were a cut in pay, she would learn how to communicate in \u201cshort\ncuts\u201d that are used in successful advertising. She also would spend time learning public relations,\nan important skill. She would learn how to get millions in free publicity. Then, at night and on\nweekends, she could be writing her great novel. When it was finished, she would be better able\nto sell her book. Then, in a short while, she could be a \u201cbest-selling author.\u201d</p> <div\nclass='story_text'>When I first came out with my first book If You Want To Be Rich and Happy,\nDon't Go to School? a publisher suggested I change the tide to The Economics of Education.

The obnoxious title If You Want\nTo Be Rich and Happy, Don't Go to School? was chosen because we knew it would get tons of\npublicity. I am pro-education and believe in education reform. Otherwise, why would I continue\nto press for changing our antiquated educational system? So I chose a title that would get me on\nmore TV and radio shows, simply because I was willing to be controversial.

Kiyosaki\nAmerica, the teachers union is the largest and the richest labor union of all. The NEA, National\nEducation Association, has tremendous political clout. Teachers need the protection of their\nunion because their skills are also of limited value to an industry outside of education. So the rule\nof thumb is, \u201cHighly specialized, then unionize.\u201d It's the smart thing to do.</p> <div\nclass='story_text'>When I ask the classes I teach, \u201cHow many of you can cook a better\nhamburger than McDonald's?\u201d almost all the students raise their hands.

The reason so many talented people are poor is because they focus on building a\nbetter hamburger and know little to nothing about business systems.</p> <div\nclass='story_text'>A friend of mine in Hawaii is a great artist. He makes a sizable amount of\nmoney. One day his mother's attorney called to tell him that she had left him $35,000. That is\nwhat was left of her estate after the attorney and the government took their shares.\nImmediately, he saw an opportunity to increase his business by using some of this money to\nadvertise. Two months later, his first four-color, full-page ad appeared in an expensive magazine\nthat targeted the very rich. The ad ran for three months. He received no replies from the ad,\nand all of his inheritance is now gone. He now wants to sue the magazine for\nmisrepresentation.</p> <div class='story_text'>This is a common case of someone who can\nbuild a beautiful hamburger, but knows little about business. When I asked him what he learned,\nhis only reply was that \u201cadvertising salespeople are crooks.\u201d I then asked him if he would be\nwilling to take a course in sales and a course in direct marketing. His reply, \u201cI don't have the\ntime, and I don't want to waste my money.\u201d</p> <div class='story_text'>The world is filled with\ntalented poor people. All too often, they're \u2022 poor or struggle financially or earn less than they\nare capable of, not f because of what they know but because of what they do not know. They\nfocus on perfecting their skills at building a better hamburger rather than the skills of selling and\ndelivering the hamburger. Maybe McDonald's does not make the best hamburger, but they are\nthe best at f selling and delivering a basic average burger.</p> <div class='story_text'>Poor dad\nwanted me to specialize. That was his view on how to be paid more. Even after being told by\nthe governor of Hawaii that he could no longer work in state government, my educated dad\ncontinued to encourage me to get specialized. Educated dad then took up the cause of the\nteachers union, campaigning for further protection and benefits for I these highly skilled and\neducated professionals. We argued often, but I know he never agreed that overspecialization is\nwhat caused the need for union protection. He never understood that the more specialized you\nbecome, the more you are trapped and dependent on that specialty.</p> <div\nclass='story_text'>Rich dad advised that Mike and I \u201cgroom\u201d ourselves. Many corporations do\nthe same thing. They find a young bright student out of business school and begin \u201cgrooming\u201d\nthat person to someday take over the company. So these bright young employees do not\nspecialize in one department; they are moved from department to department to learn all the\naspects of business systems. The rich often \u201cgroom\u201d their children or the children of others. By\ndoing so, their children gain an overall knowledge of the operations of the business and how the\nvarious departments interrelate.</p> <div class='story_text'>For the World War II generation, it\nwas considered \u201cbad\u201d to skip from company to company.

Since\npeople will skip from company to company, rather than seek greater specialization, why not\nseek to \u201clearn\u201d more than \u201cearn.\u201d In the short term, it may earn you less.

They earn that much because they have specialized skills in their field as well as\nother skills. They can teach as well as sell and market. I know of no other skills to be more\nimportant than selling as well as marketing. The skills of selling and marketing are difficult for\nmost people primarily due to their fear of rejection. The better you are at communicating,\nnegotiating and handling your fear of rejection, the easier life is. Just as I advised that\nnewspaper writer who wanted to become a \u201cbest-selling author,\u201d I advise anyone else today.\nBeing technically specialized has its strengths as well as its weaknesses. I have friends who are\ngeniuses, but they cannot communicate effectively with other human beings and, as a result,\ntheir earnings are pitiful. I advise them to just spend a year learning to sell. Even if they earn\nnothing, their communication skills will improve. And that is priceless.</p> <div\nclass='story_text'>In addition to being good learners, sellers and marketers, we need to be good\nteachers as well as good students. To be truly rich, we need to be able to give as well as to\nreceive. In cases of financial or professional struggle, there is often a lack of giving and\nreceiving. I know many people who are poor because they are neither good students nor good\nteachers.</p> <div class='story_text'>Both of my dads were generous men. Both made it a\npractice to give first. Teaching was one of their ways of giving. The more they gave, the more\nthey received. One glaring difference was in the giving of money. My rich dad gave lots of\nmoney away. He gave to his church, to charities, to his foundation. He knew that to receive\nmoney, you had to give money. Giving money is the secret to most great wealthy families. That\nis why there are organizations like the Rockefeller Foundation and the Ford Foundation. These\nare organizations designed to take their wealth and increase it, as well as give it away in\nperpetuity.</p> <div class='story_text'>My educated dad always said, \u201cWhen I have some extra\nmoney, I'll give it.\u201d The problem was, there was never any extra. So he worked harder to draw\nmore money in rather than focus on the most important law of money: \u201cGive and you shall\nreceive.\u201d Instead, he believed in \u201cReceive and then you give.\u201d</p> <div class='story_text'>In\nconclusion, I became both dads.

Kiyosaki\n \nCHAPTER EIGHT\n  Overcoming Obstacles\n  \nOnce people have studied and become financially literate, they may still face roadblocks to\nbecoming financially independent. There are five main reasons why financially literate people\nmay still not develop abundant asset columns. Asset columns that could produce large sums of\ncash flow. Asset columns that could free them to live the life they dream of, instead of working\nfull time just to pay bills. The five reasons are:\n  \n1.\t Fear.\n  \n2.\t Cynicism.\n  \n3.\t Laziness.\n  \n4.\t Bad habits.\n  \n5.\t Arrogance.\n  \nReason No. 1. Overcoming the fear of losing money. I have never met anyone who really likes\nlosing money. And in all my years, I have never met a rich person who has never lost money.\nBut I have met a lot of poor people who have never lost a dime. . .investing, that is.\n  \nThe fear of losing money is real. Everyone has it. Even the rich. But it's not fear that is the\nproblem. It's how you handle fear. It's how you handle losing. It's how you handle failure that\nmakes the difference in one's life. That goes for anything in life, not just money. The primary\ndifference between a rich person and a poor person is how they handle that fear.\n  \nIt's OK to be fearful. It's OK to be a coward when it comes to money. You can still be rich.\nWe're all heroes at something and cowards at something else. My friend's wife is an emergency\nroom nurse. When ; she sees blood, she flies into action. When I mention investing, she runs'j\naway. When I see blood, I don't run. I pass out. My rich dad understood phobias about money.\n\u201cSome people are terrified of snakes. Some people are terrified about losing money. Both are\nphobias,\u201d he would say. So his solution to the phobia of losing money was this little rhyme: \u201cIf\nyou hate risk and worry. . .start early.\u201d\n  \nThat's why banks recommend savings as a habit when you're young. J If you start young, it's\neasy to be rich. I won't go into it here, but there is a large difference between a person who\nstarts saving at age 20 versus age 30. A staggering difference.\n  \nIt is said that one of the wonders of the world is the power of compound interest. The purchase\nof Manhattan Island is said to be one of the greatest bargains of all time. New York was\npurchased for $24 in trinkets and beads. Yet, if that $24 had been invested, at 8 percent\nannually, that $24 would have been worth more than $28 trillion by 1995, Manhattan could be\nrepurchased with money left over to buy much of L.A., especially at 1995's real estate prices.\n  \nPage 78/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2599, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b10d265e-068d-4a18-88b1-0518de99aa3d": {"__data__": {"id_": "b10d265e-068d-4a18-88b1-0518de99aa3d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ba576528-db6e-4852-a3b0-0ffb58f167b4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "c2a249508c85559d34607882e0328d3adc8068390ae0c5fd9de577af14f6b724", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0089a029-16b8-42ff-aec6-0f89351b3fe4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "78", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "41799ff7f4196ae59d30f67319f98e7e465be96ca9208591dff44b2b9517c7ce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "00b4c90e-8c08-4bf1-a196-cea01dfd6c4a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d839cb3f8a41ab8b2bcda4aa4c541751afb3c458e43bb7eb5ae6d0a8b8333ad3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "66a12a08cec9ee2133b4a085e39c68d3e8e7951679ae70b3b03f39637dc6360f", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T. Kiyosaki\nMy neighbor works for a major computer company. He has been there 25 years. In five more\nyears he will leave the company with $4 million in his 401k retirement plan. It is invested mostly\nin high-growth mutual funds, which he will convert to bonds and government securities. He'll\nonly be 55 when he gets out, and he will have -a passive cash flow of over $300,000 a year,\nmore than he makes from his salary. So it can be done, even if you hate losing or hate risk. But\nyou must start early and definitely set up a retirement plan, and you should hire a financial\nplanner you trust to guide you before investing in anything.\n  \nBut what if you don't have much time left or would like to retire early? How do you handle the\nfear of losing money?\n  \nMy poor dad did nothing. He simply avoided the issue, refusing to discuss the subject.\n  \nMy rich dad, on the other hand, recommended that I think like a Texan. \u201cI like Texas and\nTexans,\u201d he used to say. \u201cIn Texas, everything is bigger. When Texans win, they win big. And\nwhen they lose, it's spectacular.\u201d\n  \n\u201cThey like losing?\u201d I asked.\n  \n\u201cThat's not what I'm saying. Nobody likes losing. Show me a happy loser, and I'll show you a\nloser,\u201d said rich dad. \u201cIt's a Texan's attitude toward risk, reward and failure I'm talking about. It's\nhow they handle life. They live it big. Not like most of the people around here, living like\nroaches when it comes to money. Roaches terrified that someone will shine a light on them.\nWhimpering when the grocery clerk short changes them a quarter.\u201d\n  \nRich dad went on to explain.\n  \n\u201cWhat I like best is the Texas attitude. They're proud when they win, and they brag when they\nlose. Texans have a saying, \u201dIf you're going to go broke, go big. You don't want to admit you\nwent broke over a duplex. Most people around here are so afraid of losing, they don't have a\nduplex to go broke with.\"\n  \nHe constantly told Mike and me that the greatest reason for lack of financial success was\nbecause most people played it too safe. \u201cPeople are so afraid of losing that they lose\u201d were his\nwords.\n  \nFran Tarkenton, a one-time great NFL quarterback, says it still another way: \u201cWinning means\nbeing unafraid to lose.\u201d In my own life, I've noticed that winning usually follows losing. Before I\nfinally learned to ride a bike, I first fell down many times. I've never met a\n  \ngolfer who has never lost a golf ball. I've never met people who have fallen in love who have\nnever had their heart broken. And I've never met someone rich who has never lost money.\n  \nSo for most people, the reason they don't win financially is because the pain of losing money is\nfar greater than the joy of being rich. Another saying in Texas is, \u201cEveryone wants to go to\nHeaven, but no one wants to die.\u201d Most people dream of being rich, but are terrified of losing\nmoney. So they never get to Heaven.\n  \nRich dad used to tell Mike and me stories about his trips to Texas. \u201cIf you really want to learn\nthe attitude of how to handle risk, losing and failure, go to San Antonio and visit the Alamo.

Kiyosaki\nAlamo is a great story of brave people who chose to fight, knowing there was no hope of\nsuccess against overwhelming odds. They chose to die instead of surrendering. It's an inspiring\nstory worthy of study; nonetheless, it's still a tragic military defeat. They got their butts kicked. A\nfailure if you will. They lost. So how do Texans handle failure? They still shout, 'Remember the\nAlamo!'\u201d\n  \nMike and I heard this story a lot. He always told us this story when f he was about to go into a\nbig deal and he was nervous. After he had done all his due diligence and now it was put up or\nshut up, he told us this story. Every time he was afraid of making a mistake, or losing money, he\ntold us this story. It gave him strength, for it reminded him that he could always turn a financial\nloss into a financial win. Rich dad I knew that failure would only make him stronger and smarter.\nIt's not that! he wanted to lose; he just knew who he was and how he would take a loss. He\nwould take a loss and make it a win. That's what made him a winner and others losers. It gave\nhim the courage to cross the line when others backed out. \u201cThat's why I like Texans so much.\nThey took a great failure and turned it into a tourist destination that makes them millions.\u201d\n  \nBut probably his words that mean the most to me today are these: \u201cTexans don't bury their\nfailures. They get inspired by them. They take i their failures and turn them into rallying cries.\nFailure inspires Texans to ' become winners. But that formula is not just the formula for Texans.\nIt j is the formula for all winners.\u201d\n  \nJust as I also said that falling off my bike was part of learning to ride. I remember falling off only\nmade me more determined to learn to ride. Not less. I also said that I have never met a golfer\nwho has never lost a ball. To be a top professional golfer, losing a ball or a tournament only\ninspires golfers to be better, to practice harder, to study more. That's what makes them better.\nFor winners, losing inspires them. For losers, losing defeats them.\n  \nQuoting John D. Rockefeller, \u201cI always tried to turn every disaster ' into an opportunity.\u201d\n  \nAnd being Japanese-American, I can say this. Many people say that Pearl Harbor was an\nAmerican mistake. I say it was a Japanese mistake. From the movie Tora, Tora, Tom, a somber\nJapanese admiral says to his cheering subordinates, \u201cI am afraid we have awakened a sleeping\ngiant.\u201d \u201cRemember Pearl Harbor\u201d became a rallying cry. It turned one of America's greatest\nlosses into the reason to win. This great defeat gave America strength, and America soon\nemerged as a world power.\n  \nFailure inspires winners. And failure defeats losers. It is the biggest secret of winners. It's the\nsecret that losers do not know. The greatest secret of winners is that failure inspires winning;\nthus, they're not afraid of losing. Repeating Fran Tarkenton's quote, \u201cWinning means being\nunafraid to lose.\u201d People like Fran Tarkenton are not afraid of losing because they know who\nthey are. They hate losing, so they know that losing will only inspire them to become better.\nThere is a big difference between hating losing and being afraid to lose. Most people are so\nafraid of losing money that they lose. They go broke over a duplex. Financially they play life too\nsafe and too small. They buy big houses and big cars, but not big investments.

But it is not a winning\nportfolio. It is a portfolio of someone playing not to lose.\n  \nDon't get me wrong. It's probably a better portfolio than more than 70 percent of the\npopulation, and that's frightening. Because a safe portfolio is a lot better than no portfolio. It's a\ngreat portfolio for someone who loves safely. But playing it safe and going \u201cbalanced\u201d on your\ninvestment portfolio is not the way successful investors play the game. If you have little money\nand you want to be rich, you must first be \u201cfocused,\u201d not \u201cbalanced.\u201d If you look at anyone\nsuccessful, at the start they were not balanced. Balanced people go nowhere. They stay in one\nspot. To make progress, you must first go unbalanced. Just look at how you make progress\nwalking.\n  \nThomas Edison was not balanced. He was focused. Bill Gates was not balanced. He was\nfocused. Donald Trump is focused. George Soros is focused. George Patton did not take his\ntanks wide. He focused them and blew through the weak spots in the German line. The French\nwent wide with the Maginot Line, and you know what happened to them.\n  \nIf you have any desire of being rich, you must focus. Put a lot of your eggs in a few baskets. Do\nnot do what poor and middle class people do: put their few eggs in many baskets.\n  \nIf you hate losing, play it safe. If losing makes you weak, play it safe. Go with balanced\ninvestments. If you're over 25 years old and are terrified of taking risks, don't change. Play it\nsafe, but start early. Start accumulating your nest egg early because it will take time.\n  \nBut if you have dreams of freedom-of getting out of the rat race- the first question to ask\nyourself is, \u201cHow do I respond to failure?\u201d If failure inspires you to win, maybe you should go for\nit-but only maybe. If failure makes you weak or causes you to throw temper tantrums-like spoiled\nbrats who call an attorney to file a lawsuit every time something does not go their way-then play\nit safe. Keep your daytime job. Or buy bonds or mutual funds. But remember, there is risk in\nthose financial instruments also, even though they are safer.\n  \nI say all this, mentioning Texas and Fran Tarkenton, because stacking the asset column is easy.\nIt's really a low-aptitude game. It doesn't take much education. Fifth-grade math will do. But\nstaking the asset column 'J is a high-attitude game. It takes guts, patience and a great attitude\ntoward failure. Losers avoid failing.

Often from friends, family, co-\nworkers and the media. Lynch recalls the time during the 1950s when the threat of nuclear war\nwas so prevalent in the news that people began building fallout shelters and storing food and\nwater. If they had invested that money wisely in the market, instead of building a fallout shelter,\nthey'd probably be financially independent today.\n  \nWhen the riots broke out in Los Angeles a few years ago, gun sales went up all over the\ncountry. A person dies from rare hamburger meat in Washington State and the Arizona Health\nDepartment orders restaurants to have all beef cooked well-done.

He was\nimpressed with what we had done through stocks and real estate. The prices of real estate in\nPhoenix were depressed. We spent two days with him showing him what we thought were\nexcellent opportunities for cash flow and capital appreciation.\n  \nMy wife and I are not real estate agents. We are strictly investors. After identifying a unit in a\nresort community, we called an agent who sold it to him that afternoon. The price was a mere\n$42,000 for a two-bedroom townhome. Similar units were going for $65,000. He had found a\nbargain. Excited, he bought it and returned to Boston.\n  \nTwo weeks later, the agent called to say that our friend had backed out. I called immediately to\nfind out why. All he said was that he talked to his neighbor, and his neighbor told him it was a\nbad deal. He was paying too much.\n  \nI asked Richard if his neighbor was an investor. Richard said \u201cno.\u201d When I asked why he listened\nto him, Richard got defensive and simply said he wanted to keep looking.\n  \nThe real estate market in Phoenix turned, and by 1994, that little unit was renting for $1,000 a\nmonth-$2,500 in the peak winter months. The unit was worth $95,000 in 1995. All Richard\nhad to put down was $5,000 and he would have had a start at getting out of the rat race.\nToday, he still has done nothing.

I\nearn 16 percent per year on my money, which certainly beats the 5 percent the bank offers.\nThe certificates are secured by real estate and enforced by state law, which is also better than\nmost banks. The formula they're bought on makes them safe. They just lack liquidity. So I look\nat them as 2 to 7-year CDs. Almost every time I tell someone, especially if they have money in\nCDs, that I hold my money this way, they will tell me it's risky. They tell me why I should not do\nit. When I ask them where they get their information, they say from a friend or an investment\nmagazine. They've never done it, and they're telling someone who's doing it why they\nshouldn't. The lowest I yield I look for is 16 percent, but people who are filled with doubt are\nwilling to accept 5 percent. Doubt is expensive.\n  \nMy point is that it's those doubts and cynicism that keep most people? poor and playing it safe.\nThe real world is simply waiting for you to get rich. Only a person's doubts keep them poor. As I\nsaid, getting out of the rat race is technically easy. It doesn't take much education, but those\ndoubts are cripplers for most people.\n  \n\u201cCynics never win,\u201d said rich dad. \u201cUnchecked doubt and fear creates i a cynic. Cynics criticize,\nand winners analyze\u201d was another of his favorite sayings. Rich dad explained that criticism\nblinded while analysis opened -< eyes. Analysis allowed winners to see that critics were blind,\nand to see opportunities that everyone else missed. And finding what people miss is | key to\nany success.\n  \nReal estate is a powerful investment tool for anyone seeking financial independence or\nfreedom. It is a unique investment tool. Yet, every time I mention real estate as a vehicle, I\noften hear, \u201cI don't want to fix toilets.\u201d\n  \nThat's what Peter Lynch calls \u201cnoise.\u201d That's what my rich dad would say is the cynic talking.\nSomeone who criticizes and does not\n  \nanalyze. Someone who lets their doubts and fears close their mind instead of open their eyes.\"\n  \nSo when someone says, \u201cI don't want to fix toilets,\u201d I want to fire back, \u201cWhat makes you think I\nwant to?\u201d They're saying a toilet is more important than what they want. I talk about freedom\nfrom the rat race, and they focus on toilets. That is the thought pattern that keeps most people\npoor.

The people who continue to say \u201cI don't want to fix toilets\u201d often deny\nthemselves the use of this powerful investment vehicle. Toilets are more important than their\nfreedom.\n  \nIn the stock market, I often hear people say, \u201cI don't want to lose money.\u201d Well, what makes\nthem think I or anyone else likes losing money? They don't make money because they chose to\nnot lose money. Instead of analyzing, they close their minds to another powerful investment\nvehicle, the stock market.\n  \nIn December 1996,1 was riding with a friend past our neighborhood gas station. He looked up\nand saw that the price of oil was going up. My friend is a worry wart or a \u201cChicken Little.\u201d To\nhim, the sky is always going to fall, and it usually does, on him.\n  \nWhen we got home, he showed me all the stats as to why the price of oil was going to go up\nover the next few years. Statistics I had never seen before, even though I already owned a\nsubstantial share block of an existing oil company. With that information, I immediately began\nlooking for and found a new undervalued oil company that was about to find some oil deposits.\nMy broker was excited about this new company, and I bought 15,000 shares for 65 cents per\nshare.\n  \nIn February 1997, this same friend and I drove by the same gas station, and sure enough, the\nprice per gallon had gone up nearly 15 percent. Again, the \u201cChicken Little\u201d worried and\ncomplained. I smiled because in January 1997, that little oil company hit oil and those 15,000\nshares went up to more than $3 per share since he had first given me the tip. And the price of\ngas will continue to go up if what my friend says is true.\n  \nInstead of analyzing, their little chicken closes their mind. If most people understood how a\n\u201cstop\u201d worked in stock-market investing, there would be more people -investing to win instead\nof investing not to lose. A \u201cstop\u201d is simply a computer command that sells your stock\nautomatically if the price begins to drop, helping to minimize your losses and maximize some\ngains.

Kiyosaki\nSo when you're in doubt and feeling a little afraid, just do what Col. Sanders did to his little\nchicken. He fried it.\n  \nReason No. 3. Laziness. Busy people are often the most lazy. We have all heard stories of a\nbusinessman who works hard to earn money. He works hard to be a good provider for his wife\nand children. He spends long hours at the office and brings work home on weekends. One day\nhe comes home to an empty house. His wife has left with the kids. He knew he and his wife\nhad problems, but rather than work to make the relationship strong, he stayed busy at work.\nDismayed, his performance at work slips and he loses his job.\n  \nToday, I often meet people who are too busy to take care of their wealth. And there are people\ntoo busy to take care of their health. The cause is the same. They're busy, and they stay busy as\na way of avoiding something they do not want to face. Nobody has to tell them. Deep down\nthey know. In fact, if you remind them, they often respond with anger or irritation.\n  \nIf they aren't busy at work or with the kids, they're often busy watching TV, fishing, playing golf\nor shopping. Yet, deep down they know they are avoiding something important. That's the\nmost common form of laziness. Laziness by staying busy.\n  \nSo what is the cure for laziness? The answer is a little greed.\n  \nFor many of us, we were raised thinking of greed or desire as bad. \u201cGreedy people are bad\npeople,\u201d my mom use to say. Yet, we all have inside of us this yearning to have nice things,\nnew things or exciting things. So to keep that emotion of desire under control, often parents\nfound ways of suppressing that desire with guilt.\n  \n\u201cYou only think about yourself. Don't you know you have brothers and sisters?\u201d was one of my\nmom's favorites. Or \u201cYou want me to buy you what?\u201d was a favorite of my dad. \u201cDo you think\nwe're made of money? Do you think money grows on trees? We're not rich people, you know.\u201d\n  \nIt wasn't so much the words but the angry guilt-trip that went with the words that got to me.\n  \nOr the reverse guilt-trip was the \u201cI'm sacrificing my life to buy this for you. I'm buying this for\nyou because I never had this advantage when I was a kid.\u201d I have a neighbor who is stone broke,\nbut can't park his car in his garage. The garage is filled with toys for his kids. Those spoiled brats\nget everything they ask for. \u201cI don't want them to know the feeling of want\u201d are his everyday\nwords. He has nothing set aside for their college or his retirement, but his kids have every toy\never made. He recently got a new credit card in the mail and took his kids to visit Las Vegas.\n\u201cI'm doing it for the kids,\u201d he said with great sacrifice.\n  \nRich dad forbade the words \u201cI can't afford it.\u201d\n  \nIn my real home, that's all I heard. Instead, rich dad required his children to say, \u201cHow can I\nafford it?\u201d His reasoning, the words \u201cI can't afford it\u201d shut down your brain. It didn't have to\nthink anymore. \u201cHow can I afford it'\u201d opened up the brain. Forced it to think and search for\nanswers.\n  \nBut most importantly, he felt the words \u201cI can't afford it\u201d were a lie. And the human spirit knew\nit. \u201cThe human spirit is very, very, powerful,\u201d he would say. \u201cIt knows it can do anything.\u201d By\nhaving a lazy mind that says, \u201cI can't afford it,\u201d a war breaks out inside you. Your spirit is angry,\nPage 85/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3391, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "599647db-0155-45a5-88a6-04012fbb8bef": {"__data__": {"id_": "599647db-0155-45a5-88a6-04012fbb8bef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7b2e62fe-acd4-49c9-a8f9-3a522392e428", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "2e47d486e2354baff626ad3dcdb00462cd024d1e37d2af9243afa99f2aed95a9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8c5a7617-1e27-4436-b388-ffd38754e0db", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "85", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "0575695a69aa7f478c9106eb6c70cd6b2c7142e7d73ff976f3b0fae816b9b6ea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8350cdf2-f86c-4a2e-8fdb-efd026ea01d4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "10956a226e035c0a840a513406e80eba7cf412d9d2739034435d8a07169cd1ff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "a2af4572b3b0937a934d0e67f35cdf666bec157c7ab93675213156ef3fd6e11e", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T.

My boss wants it finished by the morning.\"\n  \n\u201cI can't afford it\u201d also brings up sadness. A helplessness that leads to ' despondency and often\ndepression. \u201cApathy\u201d is another word. \u201cHow can I afford it?\u201d opens up possibilities, excitement\nand dreams. So rich dad , was not so concerned about what you wanted to buy, but that \u201cHow\ncan 'f j I afford it?\u201d created a stronger mind and a dynamic spirit.\n  \nThus, he rarely gave Mike or me anything. Instead he would ask, \u201cHow can you afford it?\u201d and\nthat included college, which we paid for ourselves. It was not the goal but the process of\nattaining the goal we desired that he wanted us to learn. The problem I sense today is that there\nare millions of people who feel guilty about their greed. It's an old conditioning from their\nchildhood. Their desire to have the finer things that life offers. Most have been conditioned\nsubconsciously to say, \u201cYou can't have that,\u201d or ;\n  \n\u201cYou'll never afford that.\u201d\n  \nWhen I decided to exit the rat race, it was simply a question. \u201cHow can I afford to never work\nagain?\u201d And my mind began to kick out answers and solutions. The hardest part was fighting my\nreal parents' dogma of \u201cWe can't afford that.\u201d Or \u201cStop thinking only about yourself.\u201d Or \u201cWhy\ndon't you think about others?\u201d and other such words designed to instill guilt to suppress my\ngreed.\n  \nSo how do you beat laziness? The answer is a little greed. It's that radio station WII-FM, which\nstands for \u201cWhat's In It-For Me?\u201d A person needs to sit down and ask, \u201cWhat's in it for me if I'm\nhealthy, sexy and good looking?\u201d Or \u201cWhat would my life be like if I never had to work again?\u201d\nOr \u201cWhat would I do if I had all the money I needed?\u201d Without that little greed, the desire to\nhave something better, progress is not made. Our world progresses because we all desire a\nbetter life. New inventions are made because we desire something better. We go to school and\nstudy hard because we want something better. So whenever you find yourself avoiding\nsomething you know you should be doing, then the only thing to ask yourself is \u201cWhat's in it for\nme?\u201d Be a little greedy. It's the best cure for laziness.\n  \nToo much greed, however, as anything in excess can be, is not good. But just remember what\nMichael Douglas said in the movie Wall Street. \u201cGreed is good.\u201d Rich dad said it differently:\n\"Guilt is worse than greed.\n  \nFor guilt robs the body of its soul.\u201c And to me, Eleanor Roosevelt said it best: \u201dDo what you feel\nin your heart to be right-for you'll be criticized anyway. You'll be damned if you do, and damned\nif you don't.\"\n  \nReason No. 4. Habits. Our lives are a reflection of our habits more than our education.

I decided to use the fear of the bully to\nmake me stronger. Others get weaker. Forcing myself to think about how to make extra money\nis like going to the gym and working out with weights. The more I work my mental money\nmuscles out, the stronger I get. Now, I'm not afraid of those bullies.\n  \nI liked what rich dad was saying. \u201cSo if I pay myself first, I get financially stronger, mentally and\nfiscally.\u201d\n  \nRich dad nodded.\n  \n\u201cAnd if I pay myself last, or not at all, I get weaker. So people like bosses, managers, tax\ncollectors, bill collectors and landlords push me around all my life. Just because I don't have\ngood money habits.\u201d\n  \nRich dad nodded. \u201cJust like the 96-pound weakling.\u201d\n  \nReason No. 5. Arrogance. Arrogance is ego plus ignorance. I \u201cWhat I know makes me money.\nWhat I don't know loses me money. Every time I have been arrogant, I have lost money.\nBecause when I'm arrogant, I truly believe that what I don't know is not important,\u201d rich dad\nwould often tell me.\n  \nI have found that many people use arrogance to try to hide their own ignorance. It often\nhappens when I am discussing financial statements with accountants or even other investors.\n  \nThey try to bluster their way through the discussion. It is clear to me that they don't know what\nthey're talking about. They're not lying, but they are not telling the truth.\n  \nThere are many people in the world of money, finances and investments who have absolutely\nno idea what they're talking about. Most people in the money industry are just spouting off sales\npitches like used-car salesmen.\n  \nWhen you know you are ignorant in a subject, start educating yourself by finding an expert in\nthe field or find a book on the subject.\n \nPage 88/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2863, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d1cedd5b-46e9-4fdb-9efd-166c1f0fdac7": {"__data__": {"id_": "d1cedd5b-46e9-4fdb-9efd-166c1f0fdac7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "89", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10a8e9a9-ff5f-49e3-9498-ec38c5139b9a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "89", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "56b88ff02a20fedbcb45fa22ace98c167f42673f364792f0063a372a0fbeca1a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "827f0db0-7886-47f7-8927-88ad76c22a04", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "88", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "0b774ab73e2b3e3562ec562315d09f6555af19680aa916b8020f9479277557cb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0a580d7d-10d8-4142-9533-bfca93ed3dd8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ce80eb3a87e0ec73a1c18e9406e0446e93af18cee0b2f08795302e09116e6b05", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "67d254862f8c33de74012e8d36450991904c23902fa1df477ae68027050b120a", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T. Kiyosaki\n \nCHAPTER NINE\n  Getting Started\n  \nI wish I could say acquiring wealth was easy for me, but it wasn't.\n  \nSo in response to the question \u201cHow do I start?\u201d I offer the thought process I go through on a\nday-by-day basis. It really is easy to find great deals. I promise you that. It's just like riding a bike.\nAfter a little wobbling, it's a piece of cake. But when it comes to money, it's the determination\nto get through the wobbling that's a personal thing.\n  \nTo find million-dollar \u201cdeals of a lifetime\u201d requires us to call on our financial genius. I believe that\neach of us has a financial genius within us. The problem is, our financial genius lies asleep,\nwaiting to be called upon. It lies asleep because our culture has educated us into believing that\nthe love of money is the root of all evil. It has encouraged us to learn a profession so we can\nwork for money, but failed to teach us how to have money work for us. It taught us not to worry\nabout our financial future, our company or the government would take care of us when our\nworking days are over. However, it is our children, educated in the same school system, who\nwill end up paying for it. The message is still to work hard, earn money and spend it, and when\nwe run short, we can always borrow more.\n  \nUnfortunately, 90 percent of the Western world subscribes to the above dogma, simply because\nit's easier to find a job and work for money. If you are not one of the masses, I offer you the\nfollowing ten steps to awaken your financial genius. I simply offer you the steps I have\npersonally followed. If you want to follow some of them, great. If you don't, make up your own.\nYour financial genius is smart enough to develop its own list.\n  \nWhile in Peru, with a gold miner of 45 years, I asked him how he was so confident about finding\na gold mine. He replied, \u201cThere is gold everywhere. Most people are not trained to see it.\u201d\n  \nAnd I would say that is true. In real estate, I can go out and in a day come up with four or five\ngreat potential deals, while the average person will go out and find nothing. Even looking in the\nsame neighborhood. The reason is they have not taken the time to develop their financial\ngenius.\n  \nI offer you the following ten steps as a process to develop your God-given powers. Powers only\nyou have control over.\n  \n1. I NEED A REASON GREATER THAN REALITY: The power of spirit. If you ask most\npeople if they would like to be rich or financially free, they would say \u201cyes.\u201d But then reality sets\nin. The road seems too long with too many hills to climb. It's easier to just work for money and\nhand the excess over to your broker. I once met a young woman who had dreams of swimming\nfor the U.S Olympic team. The reality was, she had to get up every morning at 4 a.m. to swim\nfor three hours before going to school. She did not party with her friends on Saturday night.\nShe had to study and keep her grades up, just like everyone else.\n  \nPage 89/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3012, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0a580d7d-10d8-4142-9533-bfca93ed3dd8": {"__data__": {"id_": "0a580d7d-10d8-4142-9533-bfca93ed3dd8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "90", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "712c8c0c-d392-4d67-8be7-2d372665cf1c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "90", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "72209e18bd4a04e4238ac8476f00155a1d4364177ca737d6fb68158b11dceca3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d1cedd5b-46e9-4fdb-9efd-166c1f0fdac7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "89", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "67d254862f8c33de74012e8d36450991904c23902fa1df477ae68027050b120a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3fe8848e-d186-4e2e-bd49-7b0c4123b8d9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f8a58ab7c5214e0e2ee8b2459fc179525c16f441af1e97ce4857648395fc5eb4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ce80eb3a87e0ec73a1c18e9406e0446e93af18cee0b2f08795302e09116e6b05", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T. Kiyosaki\nWhen I asked her what compelled her with such super-human ambition and sacrifice, she simply\nsaid, \u201cI do it for myself and the people I love. It's love that gets me over the hurdles and\nsacrifices.\u201d\n  \nA reason or a purpose is a combination of \u201cwants\u201d and \u201cdon't wants.\u201d When people ask me\nwhat my reason for wanting to be rich is, it is a combination of deep emotional \u201cwants\u201d and\n\u201cdon't wants.\u201d\n  \nI will list a few. First the \u201cdon't wants,\u201d for they create the \u201cwants.\u201d I don't want to work all my\nlife. I don't want what my parents aspired for, which was job security and a house in the suburbs.\nI don't like being an employee. I hated that my dad always missed my football games because he\nwas so busy working on his career. I hated it when my dad worked hard all his life and the\ngovernment took most of what he worked for at his death. He could not even pass on what he\nworked so hard for when he died. The rich don't do that. They work hard and pass it on to their\nchildren.\n  \nNow the wants. I want to be free to travel the world and live in the lifestyle I love. I want to be\nyoung when I do this. I want to simply be free. I want control over my time and my life. I want\nmoney to work for me.\n  \nThose are my deep-seated, emotional reasons. What are yours? If they are not strong enough,\nthen the reality of the road ahead may be greater than your reasons. I have lost money and\nbeen set back many times, but it was the deep emotional reasons that kept me standing up and\ngoing forward. I wanted to be free by age 40, but it took me until I was 4? with many learning\nexperiences along the way.\n  \nAs I said, I wish I could say it was easy. It wasn't, but it wasn't hard either. But without a strong\nreason or purpose, anything in life is hard.\n  \nIF YOU DO NOT HAVE A STRONG REASON, THERE IS NO SENSE READING FURTHER.\nIT WILL SOUND LIKE TOO MUCH WORK.\n  \n2. I CHOOSE DAILY: The power of choice. That is the main reason people want to live in a\nfree country. We want the power to choose.\n  \nFinancially, with every dollar we get in our hands, we hold the power to choose our future to be\nrich, poor or middle class. Our spending habits reflect who we are. Poor people simply have\npoor spending habits.\n  \nThe benefit I had as a boy was that I loved playing Monopoly constantly. Nobody told me\nMonopoly was only for kids, so I just kept playing the game as an adult. I also had a rich dad\nwho pointed out to me the difference between an asset and a liability. So a long time ago, as a\nlittle boy, I chose to be rich, and I knew that all I had to do was learn to acquire assets, real\nassets. My best friend, Mike, had an asset column handed to him, but he still had to choose to\nlearn to keep it. Many rich families lose their assets in the next generation simply because there\nwas no one trained to be a good steward over their assets.\n  \nMost people choose not to be rich. For 90 percent of the population, being rich is \u201ctoo much of\na hassle.\u201d So they invent sayings that go, \u201cI'm not interested in money.\u201d Or \u201cI'll never be rich.\u201d\nPage 90/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3111, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3fe8848e-d186-4e2e-bd49-7b0c4123b8d9": {"__data__": {"id_": "3fe8848e-d186-4e2e-bd49-7b0c4123b8d9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "91", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1fb88650-fbf9-4488-b1a1-1f09cda93391", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "91", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "17073c9f067e0ef8e93a5624fa4fb3aee41078512021b0c0974aa994f40c95c5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0a580d7d-10d8-4142-9533-bfca93ed3dd8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "90", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "ce80eb3a87e0ec73a1c18e9406e0446e93af18cee0b2f08795302e09116e6b05", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a49cc175-d716-4baf-99b8-2856279e4eb3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3a5ee792484006682610a294104dad6917088af5de3706ad464c06702cd714ff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "f8a58ab7c5214e0e2ee8b2459fc179525c16f441af1e97ce4857648395fc5eb4", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T. Kiyosaki\nOr \u201cI don't have to worry, I'm still young.\u201d Or \u201cWhen I make some money, then I'll think about\nmy future.\u201d Or \u201cMy husband/wife handles the finances.\u201d The problem with those statements is\nthey rob the person who chooses to\n  \nthink such thoughts of two things: one is time, which is your most precious asset, and two is\nlearning. Just because you have no money, should not be an excuse to not learn. But that is a\nchoice we all make daily, the choice of what we do with our time, our money and what we put\nin our heads. That is the power of choice. All of us have choice. I just choose to be rich, and I\nmake that choice every day.\n  \nINVEST FIRST IN EDUCATION: In reality, the only real asset you have is your mind, the most\npowerful tool we have dominion over. Just as I said about the power of choice, each of us has\nthe choice of what we put in our brain once we're old enough. You can watch MTV all day, or\nread golf magazines, or go to ceramics class or a class on financial planning. You choose. Most\npeople simply buy investments rather than\n  \nfirst invest in learning about investing.\n  \nA friend of mine, who is a rich woman, recently had her apartment burglarized. The thieves\ntook her TV and VCR and left all the books she reads. And we all have that choice. Again, 90\npercent of the population buys TV sets and only about 10 percent buy books on business or\ntapes on investments.\n  \nSo what do I do? I go to seminars. I like it when they are at least two days long because I like to\nimmerse myself in a subject. In 1973, I was watching TV and this guy came on advertising a\nthree-day seminar on how to buy real estate for nothing down. I spent $385 and that course has\nmade me at least $2 million, if not more. But more importantly, it bought me life. I don't have\nto work for the rest of my life because of that one course. I go to at least two such courses every\nyear.\n  \nI love audio tapes. The reason: I can rewind quickly. I was listening to a tape by Peter Lynch,\nand he said something I completely disagreed with. Instead of becoming arrogant and critical, I\nsimply pushed \u201crewind\u201d and I listened to that five-minute stretch of tape at least twenty times.\nPossibly more. But suddenly, by keeping my mind open, I understood why he said what he said.\nIt was like magic. I felt like I had a window into the mind of one of the greatest investors of our\ntime. I gained tremendous depth and insight into the vast resources of his education and\nexperience.\n  \nThe net result: I still have the old way I used to think, and I have Peter's way of looking at the\nsame problem or situation. I have two thoughts instead of one. One more way to analyze a\nproblem or trend, and that is priceless. Today, I often say, \u201cHow would Peter Lynch do this, or\nDonald Trump or Warren Buffett or George Soros?\u201d The only way I can access their vast mental\npower is to be humble enough to read or listen to what they have to say. Arrogant or critical\npeople are often people with low self-esteem who are afraid of taking risks. You see, if you\nlearn something new, you are then required to make mistakes in order to fully understand what\nyou have learned.\n  \nIf you have read this far, arrogance is not one of your problems. Arrogant people rarely read or\nbuy tapes. Why should they? They are the center of the universe.\nPage 91/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3382, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a49cc175-d716-4baf-99b8-2856279e4eb3": {"__data__": {"id_": "a49cc175-d716-4baf-99b8-2856279e4eb3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "92", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "08770dab-8f1e-4f97-bc77-9b414bf7f69c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "92", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "279362ec02533ee202e0dd855b2e97c17ea6c97457551f3f57e8781dfb5f033d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3fe8848e-d186-4e2e-bd49-7b0c4123b8d9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "91", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "f8a58ab7c5214e0e2ee8b2459fc179525c16f441af1e97ce4857648395fc5eb4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3ed0b8f9-f64d-4c87-bb07-96de871ebd11", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1b569a1175cb2e4d0defc1b676627bf616cbb5451e09ccdc66bb36c21210e66d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "3a5ee792484006682610a294104dad6917088af5de3706ad464c06702cd714ff", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T.

In some cases, these people who had\nmoney have become dear friends, but not all.\n  \nBut there is one distinction that I would like to point out. I've noticed that my friends with money\ntalk about money. And I do not mean brag. They're interested in the subject. So I learn from\nthem, and they learn from me. My friends, whom I know are in dire straits financially, do not\nlike talking about money, business or investing. They often think it rude or unintellectual. So I\nalso learn from my friends who struggle financially. I find out what not to do.\n  \nI have several friends who have generated over a billion dollars in their short lifetimes. The three\nof them report the same phenomenon: Their friends who have no money have never come to\nthem to ask them how they did it. But they do come asking for one of two things, or both: 1. a\nloan, or 2. a job.\n  \nA WARNING: Don't listen to poor or frightened people. I have such friends, and I love them\ndearly, but they are the \u201cChicken Littles\u201d of life. When it comes to money, especially\ninvestments, \u201cThe sky is always falling.\u201d They can always tell you why something won't work.\nThe problem is, people listen to them, but people who blindly accept doom-and-gloom\ninformation are also \u201cChicken Littles.\u201d As that old saying goes, \u201cChickens of a feather agree\ntogether.\u201d\n  \nIf you watch CNBC, which is a goldmine of investment information, they often have a panel of\nso-called \u201cexperts.\u201d One expert will say the market is going to crash, and the other will say it's\ngoing to boom. If you're smart, you listen to both. Keep your mind open because both have\nvalid points. Unfortunately, most poor people listen to \u201cChicken Little.\u201d\n  \nI have had more close friends try to talk me out of a deal or an investment.

Kiyosaki\nfriend told me he was excited because he found a 6 percent certificate of deposit. I told him I\nearn 16 percent from the state government. The next day he sent me an article about why my\ninvestment was dangerous. I have received 16 percent for years now, and he still receives 6\npercent.\n  \nI would say that one of the hardest things about wealth building is to be true to yourself and be\nwilling to not go along with the crowd. For in the market, it is usually the crowd that shows up\nlate and is slaughtered. If a great deal is on the front page, it's too late in most instances. Look\nfor a new deal. As we used to say as surfers: \u201cThere is always another wave.\u201d People who hurry\nand catch a wave late usually are the ones who wipe out.\n  \nSmart investors don't time markets. If they miss a wave, they search\n  \nfor the next one and get themselves in position. Why this is hard for most investors is because\nbuying what is not popular is frightening to them. Timid investors are like sheep going along\nwith the crowd. Or their greed gets them in when wise investors have already taken their profits\nand moved on. Wise investors buy an investment when it's not popular. They know their profits\nare made when they buy, not when they sell. They wait patiently. As I said, they do not time the\nmarket. Just like a surfer, they get in position for the next big swell.\n  \nIt's all \u201cinsider trading.\u201d There are forms of insider trading that are illegal, and there are forms of\ninsider trading that are legal. But either way, it's insider trading. The only distinction is how far\naway from the inside are you? The reason you want to have rich friends who are close to the\ninside is because that is where the money is made. It's made on information. You want to hear\nabout the next boom, get in and get out before the next bust. I'm not saying do it illegally, but\nthe sooner you know, the better your chances are for profits with minimal risk. That is what\nfriends are for. And that is financial intelligence.\n  \n4. MASTER A FORMULA AND THEN LEARN A NEW ONE: The power of learning quickly.\nIn order to make bread, every baker follows a recipe, even if it's only held in their head. The\nsame is true for making money. That's why money is often called \u201cdough.\u201d\n  \nMost of us have heard the saying \u201cYou are what you eat.\u201d I have a different slant on the same\nsaying. I say, \u201cYou become what you study.\u201d In other words, be careful what you study and\nlearn, because your mind is so powerful that you become what you put in your head. For\nexample, if you study cooking, you then tend to cook. You become a cook. If you don't want to\nbe a cook anymore, then you need to study something else. Let's say, a schoolteacher. After\nstudying teaching, you often become a teacher. And so on. Choose what you study carefully.\n  \nWhen it comes to money, the masses generally have one basic formula they learned in school.\nAnd that is, work for money. The formula I see that is predominant in the world is that every\nday millions of people get up and go to work, earn money, pay bills, balance checkbooks, buy\nsome mutual funds and go back to work. That is the basic formula, or recipe.\n  \nIf you're tired of what you're doing, or you're not making enough, it's simply a case of changing\nthe formula via which you make money.\n  \nYears ago, when I was 26,1 took a weekend class called \u201cHow to Buy Real Estate\nForeclosures.\u201d I learned a formula. The next trick was to have the discipline to actually put into\nPage 93/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3551, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ccc21522-ba93-45e9-82e6-a67cbbe0200a": {"__data__": {"id_": "ccc21522-ba93-45e9-82e6-a67cbbe0200a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "94", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b3c92be2-3916-4b28-9191-4513b2e6947e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "94", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "42413d0214d309bb0315f24c9f8321182d55cd3cb605c7d38a755511ed7b976f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3ed0b8f9-f64d-4c87-bb07-96de871ebd11", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "1b569a1175cb2e4d0defc1b676627bf616cbb5451e09ccdc66bb36c21210e66d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7c00e4bc-9f41-4149-a14f-ae1c6a547d1c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4351e20cf808d5b45f56ac48c3e2d044267c85ebe7a04a68fe67000974d99333", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "3a667f39382a25a078154016cf7b3104ec6283ede869b083c055785009d8e50a", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T. Kiyosaki\naction what I had learned. That is where most people stop. For three years, while working for\nXerox, I spent my spare time learning to master the art of buying foreclosures. I've made\nseveral million dollars using that formula, but today, it's too slow and too many other people are\ndoing it.\n  \nSo after I mastered that formula, I went in search of other formulas. For many of the classes, I\ndid not use the information I learned directly, 'i| but I always learned something new.\n  \nI have attended classes designed for only derivative traders, also a class for commodity option\ntraders and a class for Chaologists. I was way out of my league, being in a room full of people\nwith doctorates in nuclear physics and space science. Yet, I learned a lot that made my stock\nand real estate investing more meaningful and lucrative. Most junior colleges and community\ncolleges have classes on financial planning and buying of traditional investments. They are great\nplaces to start.\n  \nSo I always search for a faster formula. That is why, on a fairly regular basis, I make more in a\nday than many people will make in their lifetime.\n  \nAnother side note. In today's fast-changing world, it's not so much what you know anymore that\ncounts, because often what you know is old. It is how fast you learn. That skill is priceless. It's\npriceless in finding faster formulas-recipes, if you will, for making dough. Working hard for\nmoney is an old formula born in the day of cave men.\n  \n5. PAY YOURSELF FIRST: The power of self-discipline. If you cannot get control of yourself,\ndo not try to get rich. You might first want to join the Marine Corps or some religious order so\nyou can get control of yourself. It makes no sense to invest, make money and blow it. It is the\nlack of self-discipline that causes most lottery winners to go broke soon after winning millions. It\nis the lack of self-discipline that causes people who get a raise to immediately go out and buy a\nnew car or take a cruise.\n  \nIt is difficult to say which of the ten steps is the most important. But of all the steps, this step is\nprobably the most difficult to master if it is not already a part of your makeup. I would venture to\nsay that it is the lack of personal self-discipline that is the No. 1 delineating factor between the\nrich, the poor and the middle class.\n  \nSimply put, people who have low self-esteem and low tolerance for financial pressure can\nnever, and I mean never, be rich. As I have said, a lesson learned from my rich dad was that\n\u201cthe world will push you around.\u201d The world pushes people around not because other people\nare bullies, but because the individual lacks internal control and discipline. People who lack\ninternal fortitude often become victims of those who have self-discipline.\n  \nIn the entrepreneur classes I teach, I constantly remind people to not focus on their product,\nservice or widget, but to focus on developing management skills. The three most important\nmanagement skills necessary to start your own business are:\n  \n1.\tManagement of cash flow.\n  \n2.\tManagement of people.\n  \n3.\t Management of personal time.\nPage 94/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3188, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c00e4bc-9f41-4149-a14f-ae1c6a547d1c": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c00e4bc-9f41-4149-a14f-ae1c6a547d1c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "de3532e5-62f3-48e7-8bb3-577fed9bd48c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "47218554b76f9ab68d7595f662931e507ff76d778b96474d9974cab9222e126f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ccc21522-ba93-45e9-82e6-a67cbbe0200a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "94", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "3a667f39382a25a078154016cf7b3104ec6283ede869b083c055785009d8e50a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2a252abf-b0db-4863-b8ad-db8ad2d78cc6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "192048816599a0dcc71439bd606fd13223ecd7feb6141bda32ac8fa1d8fd9b22", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "4351e20cf808d5b45f56ac48c3e2d044267c85ebe7a04a68fe67000974d99333", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T.

The\nthree matter in the way you live your life as an individual, or as part of a family, a business, a\ncharitable organization, a city or a nation.\n  \nEach of these skills is enhanced by the mastery of self discipline.

As I said, financial literacy allows one to read\nnumbers, and numbers tell the story.

Again, it has to do with\nunderstanding cash flow, which tells the story. Most people look at the numbers and miss the\nstory. If you can truly begin to understand the power of cash flow, you will soon realize what is\nwrong with the picture on the next page, or why 90 percent of most people work hard all their\nlives and need government support like Social Security when they are no longer able to work.\n  \nDo you see it? The diagram above reflects the actions of an individual who chooses to pay\nhimself first. Each month, they allocate money to their asset column before they pay their\nmonthly expenses. Although millions of people have read Classen's book and understand the\nwords \u201cpay yourself first,\u201d in reality they pay themselves last.\n  \nNow I can hear the howls from those of you who sincerely believe in paying your bills first. And I\ncan hear all the \u201cresponsible\u201d people who pay their bills on time. I am not saying be\nirresponsible and not pay your bills. All I am saying is do what the book says, which is \u201cpay\nyourself first.\u201d And the diagram above is the correct accounting picture of that action. Not the\none that follows.\n  \nMy wife and I have had many bookkeepers and accountants and bankers who have had a major\nproblem with this way of looking at \u201cpay yourself first.\u201d The reason is that these financial\nprofessionals actually do what the masses do, which is pay themselves last. They pay everyone\nelse first.\n  \nThere have been months in my life, when for whatever reason, cash flow was far less than my\nbills. I still paid myself first. My accountant and bookkeeper screamed in panic. \u201cThey're going\nto come after you. The IRS is going to put you in jail.\u201d \u201cYou're going to ruin your credit rating.\u201d\n\u201cThey'll cut off the electricity.\u201d I still paid myself first.\n  \n\u201cWhy?\u201d you ask. Because that's what the story The Richest Man In Babylon was all about. The\npower of self-discipline and the power of internal fortitude. \u201cGuts,\u201d in less elegant terms. As my\nrich dad taught me the first month I worked for him, most people allow the world to push them\naround. A bill collector calls and you \u201cpay or else.\u201d So you pay and not pay yourself. A sales\nclerk says, \u201cOh, just put it on your charge card.\u201d Your real estate agent tells you to \u201cgo ahead-\nthe government allows you a tax deduction on your home.\u201d That is what the book is really\nabout. Having the guts to go against the tide and get rich. You may not be weak, but when it\ncomes to money, many people get wimpy.\n  \nI am not saying be irresponsible. The reason I don't have high credit card debt, and doodad\ndebt, is because I want to pay myself first. The reason I minimize my income is because I don't\nwant to pay it to the government. That is why, for those of you who have watched the video\nThe Secrets of the Rich, my income comes from my asset column, through a Nevada\ncorporation.

Although I\npay my bills last, I set it up to have only small unimportant bills, that I will have to pay.\n  \nSecondly, when I occasionally come up short, I still pay myself first. I let the creditors and even\nthe government scream. I like it when they get tough. Why? Because those guys do me a favor.\nThey inspire me to i go out and create more money. So I pay myself first, invest the money,\nand let the creditors yell. I generally pay them right away anyway. My wife and I have excellent\ncredit. We just don't cave into the pressure and spend our savings or liquidate stocks to pay for\nconsumer debt. That is not too financially intelligent.\n  \nSo the answer is:\n  \n1.\t Don't get into large debt positions that you have to pay for. Keep your expenses low. Build\nup assets first. Then, buy the big house or nice car. Being stuck in the rat race is not intelligent.\n  \n2.\t When you come up short, let the pressure build and don't dip into your savings or\ninvestments. Use the pressure to inspire your financial genius to come up with new ways of\nmaking more money and then pay your bills. You will have increased your ability to make more\nmoney as well as your financial intelligence. ; : So many times I have gotten into financial hot\nwater, and used my brain to create more income, while staunchly defending the assets in my\nasset column. My bookkeeper has screamed and dived for cover, but I was like a good trooper\ndefending the fort, Fort Assets.\n  \nPoor people have poor habits. A common bad habit is innocently called \u201cDipping into savings.\u201d\nThe rich know that savings are only used to create more money, not to pay bills.\n  \nI know that sounds tough, but as I said, if you're not tough inside, the world will always push you\naround anyway.\n  \nIf you do not like financial pressure, then find a formula that works for you. A good one is to cut\nexpenses, put your money in the bank, pay more than your fair share of income tax, buy safe\nmutual funds and take the vow of the average. But this violates the \u201cpay yourself first\u201d rule.\n  \nThe rule does not encourage self-sacrifice or financial abstinence. It doesn't mean pay yourself\nfirst and starve. Life was meant to be enjoyed. If you call on your financial genius, you can have\nall the goodies of life, get rich and pay bills, without sacrificing the good life. And that is financial\nintelligence.\n  \n6. PAY YOUR BROKERS WELL: The power of good advice. I often see people posting a sign\nin front of their house that says, \u201cFor Sale by Owner.\u201d Or I see on TV today many people\nclaiming to be \u201cDiscount Brokers.\u201d\n  \nMy rich dad taught me to take the opposite tack. He believed in paying professionals well, and I\nhave adopted that policy also. Today, I have expensive attorneys, accountants, real estate\nbrokers and stockbrokers. Why? Because if, and I do mean if, the people are professionals, their\nservices should make you money. And the more money they make, the more money I make.\n  \nWe live in the Information Age. Information is priceless. A good broker should provide you with\ninformation as well as take the time to educate you. I have several brokers who are willing to do\nthat for me. Some taught me when I had little or no money, and I am still with them today.\nPage 97/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3390, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4fab869f-91fe-4adc-bdce-d322fbb70e4e": {"__data__": {"id_": "4fab869f-91fe-4adc-bdce-d322fbb70e4e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "98", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "21db1049-c25c-4851-8524-d17ba9e31cf2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "98", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "aa013e5cac368f45defcc7587bdbf47300145ed387be87f8f97aca95f61d58c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8dc69a60-e7d4-4c90-86e8-329defde273c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "97", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "279359cbce00320b5fa84263990c5e0e5a3cc470cad3c4f03e5ed783a3c2bcd7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cc8a866f-9380-4d2e-8e2a-0c53a2686b20", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "628dc9b72fdbf62844b258100ef006cfa534a7cc984538b26d8f259dfb09a8f4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ef76f123ab8b4cbcf2dd3ba651190780daaa1c3fbb2220f3b3439098b33dcc76", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T. Kiyosaki\n  \nWhat I pay a broker is tiny in comparison with what kind of money I can make because of the\ninformation they provide. I love it when my real estate broker or stockbroker makes a lot of\nmoney. Because it usually means I made a lot of money.\n  \nA good broker saves me time in addition to making me money-as when I bought the piece of\nvacant land for $9,000 and sold it immediately for over $25,000, so I could buy my Porsche\nquicker.\n  \nA broker is your eyes and ears to the market. They're there every day so I do not have to be. I'd\nrather play golf.\n  \nAlso, people who sell their house on their own must not value their time much. Why would I\nwant to save a few bucks when I could use that time to make more money or spend it with those\nI love? What I find funny is that so many poor and middle class people insist on tipping\nrestaurant help 15 to 20 percent even for bad service and complain about paying a broker 3 to\n7 percent. They enjoy tipping people in the\n  \nexpense column and stiffing people in the asset column. That is not financially intelligent.\n  \nAll brokers are not created equal. Unfortunately, most brokers are only salespeople. I would say\nthe real estate salespeople are the worst.\n  \nThey sell, but they themselves own little or no real estate. There is a tremendous difference\nbetween a broker who sells houses and a broker who sells investments. And that is true for\nstock, bond, mutual fund and insurance brokers who call themselves financial planners. As in the\nfairy tale, you kiss a lot of frogs to find one prince. Just remember the old saying, \u201cNever ask an\nencyclopedia salesperson if you need an encyclopedia.\u201d\n  \nWhen I interview any paid professional, I first find out how much property or stocks they\npersonally own and what percentage they pay in taxes. And that applies to my tax attorney as\nwell as my accountant. I have an accountant who minds her own business. Her profession is\naccounting, but her business is real estate. I used to have an accountant that was a small\nbusiness accountant, but he had no real estate. I switched because we did not love the same\nbusiness.\n  \nFind a broker who has your best interests at heart. Many brokers will .'; spend the time\neducating you, and they could be the best asset you find. Just be fair, and most of them will be\nfair to you. If all you can think about is cutting their commissions, then why should they want to\nbe around you? It's just simple logic.\n  \nAs I said earlier, one of the management skills is the management of people. Many people only\nmanage people they feel smarter than and they have power over, such as subordinates in a\nwork situation. Many middle managers remain middle managers, failing to get promoted\nbecause they know how to work with people below them, but not with people above them. The\nreal skill is to manage and pay well the people who are smarter than you in some technical area.\nThat is why companies have a board of directors. You should have one, too. And that is\nfinancial intelligence.\n  \n7. BE AN \u201cINDIAN GIVER\u201d: This is the power of getting something for nothing.

Kiyosaki\nwhite settlers came to America, they were taken aback by a cultural practice some American\nIndians had. For example, if a settler was cold, the Indian would give the person a blanket.\nMistaking it for a gift, the settler was often offended when the Indian asked for it back.\n  \nThe Indians also got upset when they realized the settlers did not want to give it back. That is\nwhere the term \u201cIndian giver\u201d came from. A simple cultural misunderstanding.\n  \nIn the world of the \u201casset column,\u201d being an Indian giver is vital to wealth. The sophisticated\ninvestor's first question is, \u201cHow fast do I get my money back?\u201d They also want to know what\nthey get for free, also called a piece of the action. That is why the ROI, or return of and on\ninvestment, is so important.\n  \nFor example, I found a small condominium, a few blocks from where I live, that was in\nforeclosure. The bank wanted $60,000, and I submitted a bid for $50,000, which they took,\nsimply because, along with my bid, was a cashier's check for $50,000. They realized I was\nserious. Most investors would say, aren't you tying up a lot of cash? Would it not be better to get\na loan on it? The answer is, not in this case. My investment company uses this as a vacation\nrental in the winter months, when the \u201csnowbirds\u201d come to Arizona, and rent it for $2,500 a\nmonth for four months out of the year. For rental during the off?season, it rents for only $1,000\na month. I had my money back in about three years. Now I own this asset, which pumps money\nout for me, month in and month out.\n  \nThe same is done with stocks. Frequently, my broker will call me and recommend I move a\nsizable amount of money into the stock of a company that he feels is just about to make a move\nthat will add value to the stock, like announcing a new product. I will move my money in for a\nweek to a month while the stock moves up. Then, I pull my initial dollar amount out, and stop\nworrying about the fluctuations of the market, because my initial money is back and ready to\nwork on another asset. So my money goes in, and then it comes out, and I own an asset that\nwas technically free.\n  \nTrue, I have lost money on many occasions. But I only play with money I can afford to lose. I\nwould say, on an average ten investments, I hit home runs on two or three, while five or six do\nnothing, and I lose on two or three. But I limit my losses to only the money I have in at that\ntime.\n  \nFor people who hate risk, they put their money in the bank. And in the long run, savings are\nbetter than no savings. But it takes a long time to get your money back and, in most instances,\nyou don't get anything for free with it. They used to hand out toasters, but they rarely do that\nthese days.\n  \nOn every one of my investments, there must be an upside, something for free. A condominium,\na mini-storage, a piece of free land, a house, stock shares, office building. And there must be\nlimited risk, or a low-risk idea. There are books devoted entirely to this subject that I will not get\ninto here. Ray Kroc, of McDonald's fame, sold hamburger franchises, not because he loved\nhamburgers, but because he wanted the real estate ; under the franchise for free.\n  \nSo wise investors must look at more than ROI; it's the assets you get for free once you get your\nmoney back.

Can you use this desire to own a car and inspire your son to learn\nsomething?\u201d Suddenly the lights went on, and he hurried home.\n  \nTwo months later I ran into my friend again. \u201cDoes your son have his new car?\u201d I asked.\n  \n\u201cNo, he doesn't. But I went and handed him $3,000 for the car. I told him to use my money\ninstead of his college money.\u201d \u201cWell, that's generous of you,\u201d I said.\n  \n\u201cNot really. The money came with a hitch. I took your advice of using his strong desire to buy a\ncar and use that energy so he could learn something.\u201d\n  \n\u201cSo what was the hitch?\u201d I asked.\n  \n\u201cWell, first we broke out your game again, CASHFLOW. We played it and had a long discussion\nabout the wise use of money. I then gave him a subscription to the Wall Street Journal, and a\nfew books on the stock market.\u201d\n  \n\u201cThen what?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat was the catch?\u201d\n  \n\u201cI told him the $3,000 was his, but he could not directly buy a car with it. He could use it to buy\nand sell stocks, find his own stockbroker, and once he had made $6,000 with the $3,000, the\nmoney would be his for the car, and the $3,000 would go into his college fund.\u201d\n  \n\u201cAnd what are the results?\u201d I asked.\n  \n\"Well, he got lucky early in his trading, but lost all he gained a few days later. Then, he really got\ninterested. Today, I would say he is down $2,000, but his interest is up. He has read all the\nbooks I bought him and he's gone to the library to get more. He reads the Wall Street Journal\nvoraciously, watching for indicators, and he watches CNBC instead of MTV. He's got only\n$1,000 left, but his interest and learning are sky high. He knows that if he loses that money, he\nwalks for two more years. But he does not seem to care. He even seems\n  \nuninterested in getting a car because he's found a game that is more fun.\"\n  \n\u201cWhat happens if he loses all the money?\u201d I asked.\n  \n\u201cWe'll cross that bridge when we get to it. I'd rather have him lose everything now rather than\nwait till he's our age to risk losing everything. And besides, that is the best $3,000 I've ever\nspent on his education.

Kiyosaki\nasset column in theory is easy, it is the mental fortitude of directing money that is hard. Due to\nexternal temptations, it is much easier in today's consumer world to simply blow it out the\nexpense column. Because of weak mental fortitude, that money flows into the paths of least\nresistance. That is the cause of poverty and financial struggle.\n  \nI gave this numerical example of financial intelligence, in this case the ability to direct money to\nmake more money. If we gave 100 people $10,000 at the start of the year, I gave my opinion\nthat at the end of the year:\n  \n80 would have nothing left. In fact, many would have created I greater debt by making a down\npayment on a new car, refrigerator, TV, VCR or a holiday. 16 would have increased that\n$10,000 by 5 percent to 10 percent. 4 would have increased it to $20,000 or into the millions.\n  \nWe go to school to learn a profession so we can work for money. It is my opinion that it is also\nimportant to learn how to have money work for you.\n  \nI love my luxuries as much as anyone else. The difference is, some people buy their luxuries on\ncredit. It's the keep-up-with-the-Joneses trap. When I wanted to buy a Porsche, the easy road\nwould have been to call my banker and get a loan. Instead of choosing to focus in the liability\ncolumn, I chose to focus in the asset column.\n  \nAs a habit, I used my desire to consume to inspire and motivate my financial genius to invest.\n  \nToo often today, we focus to borrowing money to get the things we want instead of focusing on\ncreating money. One is easier in the short term, but harder in the long term. It's a bad habit that\nwe as individuals and as a nation have gotten into. Remember, the easy road often becomes\nhard, and the hard road often becomes easy.\n  \nThe earlier you can train yourself and those you love to be masters of money, the better. Money\nis a powerful force. Unfortunately, people use the power of money against them. If your\nfinancial intelligence is low, money will run all over you. It will be smarter than you. If money is\nsmarter than you, you will work for it all your life.\n  \nTo be the master of money, you need to be smarter than it. Then money will do as it is told. It\nwill obey you. Instead of being a slave to it, you will be the master of it. That is financial\nintelligence.\n  \n9. THE NEED FOR HEROES: The power of myth. When I was a kid, I greatly admired Willie\nMays, Hank Aaron, Yogi Berra. They were my heroes. As a kid playing Little League, I wanted\nto be just like them. I treasured their baseball cards. I wanted to know everything about them. I\nknew the stats, the RBI, the ERAs, their batting averages, how much they got paid, and how\nthey came up 1 from the minors. I wanted to know everything because I wanted to be just like\nthem.\n  \nEvery time, as a 9 or 10 year-old kid, when I stepped up to bat or played first base or catcher, I\nwasn't me. I was Yogi or Hank. It's one of the most powerful ways we learn that we often lose\nas adults. We lose our heroes. We lose our naivete.\n  \nToday, I watch young kids playing basketball near my home. On the court they're not little\nJohnny; they're Michael Jordan, Sir Charles or Clyde.

Someone people grew up with,\nlooked up to, and wanted to be like. Suddenly we need to rid ourselves of that person.\n  \nI have new heroes as I grow older. I have golf heroes such as Peter Jacobsen, Fred Couples and\nTiger Woods. I copy their swings and do my best to read everything I can about them. I also\nhave heroes such as Donald Trump, Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, George Soros and Jim\nRogers. In my older years, I know their stats just like I knew the ERAs and RBI of my baseball\nheroes. I follow what Warren Buffett invests in, and read anything I can about his point of view\non the market. I read Peter Lynch's book to understand how he chooses stocks. And I read\nabout Donald Trump, trying to find out how he negotiates and puts deals together.\n  \nJust as I was not me when I was up to bat, when I'm in the market or I'm negotiating a deal, I\nam subconsciously acting with the bravado of Trump. Or when analyzing a trend, I look at it as\nthough Peter Lynch were doing it. By having heroes, we tap into a tremendous source of raw\ngenius.\n  \nBut heroes do more than simply inspire us.

It's the making it\nlook easy that convinces us to want to be just like them. \u201cIf they can do it, so can I.\u201d\n  \nWhen it comes to investing, too many people make it sound hard. Instead find heroes who\nmake it look easy.\n  \n10. TEACH AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE: The power of giving. Both of my dads were\nteachers. My rich dad taught me a lesson I have carried all my life, and that was the necessity of\nbeing charitable or giving. My educated dad gave a lot by the way of time and knowledge, but\nalmost never gave away money. As I said, he usually said that he would give when he had some\nextra money. Of course, there was rarely any extra.\n  \nMy rich dad gave money as well as education. He believed firmly in tithing. \u201cIf you want\nsomething, you first need to give,\u201d he would always say. When he was short of money, he\nsimply gave money to his church or to his favorite charity.\n  \nIf I could leave one single idea with you, it is that idea. Whenever you feel \u201cshort\u201d or in \u201cneed\u201d\nof something, give what you want first and it will come back in buckets. That is true for money,\na smile, love, friendship. I know it is often the last thing a person may want to do, but; it has\nalways worked for me. I just trust that the principle of reciprocity it is true, and I give what I\nwant. I want money, so I give money, and it comes back in multiples. I want sales, so I help\nsomeone else sell something, and sales come to me. I want contacts and I help someone else\nget contacts, and like magic, contacts come to me. I heard a saying years ago that went, \u201cGod\ndoes not need to receive, but humans need to give.\u201d\n  \nMy rich dad would often say, \u201cPoor people are more greedy than rich people.\u201d He would\nexplain that if a person was rich, that person was providing something that other people\nwanted. In my life, over all these ; years, whenever I have felt needy or short of money or short\nof help, I simply went out or found in my heart what I wanted, and decided to give it first. And\nwhen I gave, it always came back.\n \nPage 102/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3380, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b469e54-36be-43e2-9f8f-89cb73b3da0e": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b469e54-36be-43e2-9f8f-89cb73b3da0e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "103", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "595ad52f-2c63-4a18-a0b1-5ced6a47ef8e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "103", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "01471b099b04e0cd854dc60facfb5b35aee5aaca3eaa05b338aa93b2de59925b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0bec207c-4e29-445d-b4e0-f165b249a277", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "102", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "20c7fca23d75d51dfbb6f92108776aa00f850c230fb4ec0a46d7e0b4e0ec3483", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c0636766-95c1-4a3f-884c-4259e32aa024", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "76e60b4b4df92ab5a060e8ef89128f190c91e3c0be3f858c0210d355c8262dea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "2dc01766f5a02340b09760218e6b6a118678c8dc1fb5a9502d9b9a90fef37225", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T.

Kiyosaki\n \nCHAPTER TEN\n  Still Want More? Here are Some To Do's\n  \nMany people may not be satisfied with my ten steps. They see them more as philosophies than\nactions. I think understanding the philosophy is just as important as the action. There are many\npeople who want to do, instead of think, and then there are people who think but do not do. I\nwould say that I am both. I love new ideas and I love action.\n  \nSo for those who want \u201cto dos\u201d on how to get started, I will share with you some of the things I\ndo, in abbreviated form.\n  \nStop doing what you're doing. In other words, take a break and assess what is working and what\nis not working. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different\nresult. Stop doing what is not working and look for something new to do.\n  \nLook for new ideas. For new investing ideas, I go to bookstores and look for books on different\nand unique subjects. I call them formulas. I buy how-to\n  \nbooks on a formula I know nothing about. For example, it was in the bookstore that I found the\nbook The 16 Percent Solution, by Joel Moskowitz. I bought the book and read it.\n  \nTAKE ACTION! The next Thursday, I did exactly as the book said. Step by step. I have also\ndone that with finding real estate bargains in attorneys' offices and in banks. Most people do not\ntake action, or they let someone talk them out of whatever new formula they are studying. My\nneighbor told me why 16 percent would not work. I did not listen to him because he's never\ndone it.\n  \nFind someone who has done what you want to do. Take them to lunch. Ask them for tips, for\nlittle tricks of the trade. As for 16 percent tax lien certificates, I went to the county tax office and\nfound the government employee who worked in the office. I found out that she, too, invested in\nthe tax liens. Immediately, she was invited to lunch. She was thrilled to tell me everything she\nknew and how to do it. After lunch, she spent all afternoon showing me everything. By the next\nday, I found two great properties with her help and have been accruing interest at 16 percent\never since. It took a day to read the book, a day to take action, an hour for lunch, and a day to\nacquire two great deals.\n  \nTake classes and buy tapes. I search the newspapers for new and interesting classes. Many are\nfor free or a small fee. I also attend and pay for expensive seminars on what I want to learn. I\nam wealthy and free from needing a job simply because of the courses I took. I have friends who\ndid not take those classes who told me I was wasting my money, and yet they're still at the same\njob.\n  \nMake lots of offers. When I want a piece of real estate, I look at many properties and generally\nwrite an offer. If you don't know what the \u201cright offer\u201d is, neither do I.

Kiyosaki\nA friend wanted me to show her how to buy apartment houses. So one Saturday she, her agent\nand I went and looked at six apartment houses. Four were dogs, but two were good. I said to\nwrite offers on all six, offering half of what the owners asked for. She and the agent nearly had\nheart attacks. They thought it would be rude, that I might offend the sellers, but I really don't\nthink the agent wanted to work that hard. So they did nothing and went on looking for a better\ndeal.\n  \nNo offers were ever made, and that person is still looking for the \u201cright\u201d deal at the right price.\nWell, you don't know what the right price is until you have a second party who wants to deal.\nMost sellers ask too much. It is rare that a seller will actually ask a price that is less than\nsomething is worth.\n  \nMoral of the story: Make offers. People who are not investors have no idea what it feels like to\nbe trying to sell something. I have had a piece of real estate that I wanted to sell for months. I\nwould have welcomed anything. I would not care how low the price. They could have offered\nme ten pigs and I would have been happy. Not at the offer, but just because someone was\ninterested. I would have countered, maybe for a pig farm in exchange. But that's how the game\nworks. The game of buying and selling is fun. Keep that in mind. It's fun and only a game. Make\noffers. Someone might say \u201cyes.\u201d\n  \nAnd I always make offers with escape clauses. In real estate, I make an offer with the words\n\u201csubject to approval of business partner.\u201d I never specify who the business partner is. Most\npeople do not know my partner is my cat. If they accept the offer, and I don't want the deal, I\ncall my home and speak to my cat. I make this absurd statement to illustrate how absurdly easy\nand simple the game is. So many people make things too difficult and take them too seriously.\n  \nFinding a good deal, the right business, the right people, the right investors, or whatever is just\nlike dating. You must go to the market and talk to a lot of people, make a lot of offers,\ncounteroffers, negotiate, reject and accept. I know single people who sit at home and wait for\nthe phone to ring, but unless you're Cindy Crawford or Tom Cruise, I think you'd best go to the\nmarket, even if it's only the supermarket. Search, offer, reject, negotiate and accept are all parts\nof the process of almost everything in life.\n  \n\u2022 Jog, walk or drive a certain area once a month for ten minutes. I have found some of my best\nreal estate investments while jogging. I will jog a certain neighborhood for a year. What I look\nfor is change. For there to be profit in a deal, there must be two elements: a bargain and\nchange. There are lots of bargains, but it's change that turns a bargain into a profitable\nopportunity. So when I jog, I jog a neighborhood I might like to invest in. It is the repetition that\ncauses me to notice slight differences. I notice real estate signs that are up for a long time. That\nmeans the seller might be more agreeable to deal. I watch for moving trucks, going in or out. I\nstop and talk to the drivers. I talk to the postal carriers. It's amazing how much information they\nacquire about an area.\n  \nI find a bad area, especially an area that the news has scared everyone away from. I drive it for\nsometimes a year waiting for signs of something changing for the better. I talk to retailers,\nespecially new ones, and find out why they're moving in. It takes only a few minutes a month,\nand I do it while doing something else, like exercising, or going\n  \nPage 105/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3623, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0f0c84e-7ef2-4a28-98e4-7e67281aaf00": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0f0c84e-7ef2-4a28-98e4-7e67281aaf00", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "106", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "256456fc-7e07-4869-9a76-b2c3b17f860d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "106", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "d92713b855e25e72107310e10a86654f8236ff0d014f2dd480970fea253f8956", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "621ad0e6-1f6a-451d-9e56-e67733f64c04", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "105", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "ce9b1e086b22db52b6bce698c65a8769f4f602b100b7d1d6b859bd5f0d8836ec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "122c4268-39d0-4161-8ce1-068408b4812e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ce9def1d244fa665be026f935cd9a7f6133f87be1b2a79620ac7db81d4f1ce77", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "94f60d03b0f37957e237e0d9d9d26d8bd778212db2a28e799aa16bfe580e8429", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T. Kiyosaki\nto and from the store.\n  \nAs for stocks, I like Peter Lynch's book Beating the Street for his formula for selecting stocks\nthat grow in value. I have found that the principles of finding value are the same regardless if it's\nreal estate, stocks, mutual funds, new companies, a new pet, a new home, a new spouse, or a\nbargain on laundry detergent. The process is always the same. You need to know what you're\nlooking for and then go look for it!\n  \nWhy consumers will always be poor. When the supermarket has a sale on, say, toilet paper, the\nconsumer runs in and stocks up. When the stock market has a sale, most often called a crash or\ncorrection, the consumer runs away from it. When the supermarket raises its prices, the\nconsumer shops elsewhere. When the stock market raises its prices, the consumer starts buying.\n  \nLook in the right places. A neighbor bought a condominium for $100,000. I bought the\nidentical condo next door to his for $50,000. He told me he's waiting for the price to go up. I\ntold him that his profit is made when you buy, not when you sell. He shopped with a real estate\nbroker who owns no property of her own. I shopped at the foreclosure department of a bank. I\npaid $500 for a class on how to do this. My neighbor thought that the $500 for a real estate\ninvestment class was too expensive. He said he could not afford it, and he couldn't afford the\ntime. So he waits for the price to go up.\n  \nI look for people who want to buy first, then I look for someone who wants to sell. A friend was\nlooking for a certain piece of land. He had the money and did not have the time. I found a large\npiece of land larger than what my friend wanted to buy, tied it up with an option, called my\nfriend and he wanted a piece of it. So I sold the piece to him and then bought the land. I kept\nthe remaining land as mine for free. Moral of the story: Buy the pie and cut it in pieces. Most\npeople look for what they can afford, so they look too small. They buy only a piece of the pie,\nso they end up paying more for less.\n  \nSmall thinkers don't get the big breaks. If you want to get richer, think bigger first.\n  \nRetailers love giving volume discounts, simply because most business people love big spenders.\nSo even if you're small, you can always think big. When my company was in the market for\ncomputers, I called several friends and asked them if they were ready to buy also. We then went\nto different dealers and negotiated a great deal because we wanted to buy so many. I have done\nthe same with stocks. Small people remain small because they think small; act alone, or don't\nact all.\n  \n\u2022 Learn from history. All the big companies on the stock exchange started out as small\ncompanies. Colonel Sanders did not get rich until after he lost everything in his 60s. Bill Gates\nwas one of the richest men in the world before he was 30.\n  \n\u2022 Action always beats inaction.\n  \nThese are just a few of the things I have done and continue to do to recognize opportunities.\nThe important words being \u201cdone\u201d and \u201cdo\u201d. As repeated many times throughout the book, you\nmust take action before you can receive the financial rewards.

Kiyosaki\nHow To Pay for a Child's College Education for $7000\n  \nAs the book draws to a close and approaches publication, I would like to share a final thought\nwith you. The main reason I wrote this book was to share insights into how increased financial\nintelligence can be used to solve many of life's common problems. Without financial training, we\nall too often use the standard formulas to get through life, such as to work hard, save, borrow\nand pay excessive taxes. Today we need better information.\n  \nI use the following story as a final example of a financial problem that confronts many young\nfamilies today. How do you afford a good education for your children and provide for your own\nretirement? It is an example of using financial intelligence instead of hard work to achieve the\nsame goal.\n  \nA friend of mine was griping one day about how hard it was to save money for his four\nchildren's college education. He was putting $300 away in a mutual fund each month and had\nso far accumulated about $12,000. He estimated he needed $400,000 to get four children\nthrough college. He had 12 years to save for it, since his oldest child was then 6 years of age.\n  \nThe year was 1991, and the real estate market in Phoenix was terrible. People were giving\nhouses away. I suggested to my classmate that he buy a house with some of the money in his\nmutual fund. The idea intrigued him and we began to discuss the possibility. His primary concern\nwas that he did not have the credit with the bank to buy another house, since he was so over-\nextended. I assured him that there were other ways to finance a property other than through\nthe bank.\n  \nWe looked for a house for two weeks, a house that would fit all the criteria we were looking for.\nThere were a lot to choose from, so the shopping was kind of fun. Finally, we found a 3\nbedroom 2 bath home in a prime neighborhood. The owner had been downsized and needed to\nsell that day because he and his family were moving to California where another job waited.\n  \nHe wanted $102,000, but we offered only $79,000. He took it immediately. The home had on\nit what is called a non-qualifying loan, which means even a bum without a job could buy it\nwithout a banker's approval. The owner owed $72,000 so all my friend had to come up with\nwas $7,000, the difference in price between what was owed and what it sold for. As soon as the\nowner moved, my friend put the house up for rent. After all expenses were paid, including the\nmortgage, he put about $125 in his pocket each month.\n  \nHis plan was to keep the house for 12 years and let the mortgage get paid down faster, by\napplying the extra $125 to the principle each month. We figured that in 12 years, a large\nportion of the mortgage would be paid off and he could possibly be clearing $800 a month by\nthe time his first child went to college. He could also sell the house if it had appreciated in value.\n  \nIn 1994, the real estate market suddenly changed in Phoenix and he was offered $156,000 for\nthe same house by the tenant who lived in it and loved it. Again, he asked me what I thought,\nand I naturally said sell, on a 1031 tax-deferred exchange.\n  \nSuddenly, he had nearly $80,000 to operate with. I called another friend in Austin, Texas who\nthen moved this tax deferred money into a mini-storage facility. Within three months, he began\nreceiving checks for a little less than a $1,000 a month in income which he then poured back\nPage 107/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3503, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a303db4-6cc7-42d2-8d2b-988057b9effb": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a303db4-6cc7-42d2-8d2b-988057b9effb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e201f14b-cd23-4c7c-b976-81be2aa80e34", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "954e2489e6cfaa771409b3b593ed00739228ee07aab85b27c215af8afb12c734", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "122c4268-39d0-4161-8ce1-068408b4812e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "107", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "ce9def1d244fa665be026f935cd9a7f6133f87be1b2a79620ac7db81d4f1ce77", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8162f2bc-8b79-477e-a0e5-f52927eb5976", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bf7c5098ffa3fea15cf72a92309ca52382de9ea416c8f627c8c62ea168436c2f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "a93cbe521428e0969b855f8eecff2c08269eea13f3c976afd1f1a1ed3cae9f22", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T.

As a result of this successful investment strategy he\nwill be able to retire early.\n  \nThank you for reading this book. I hope it has provided some insights into utilizing the power of\nmoney to work for you. Today, we need greater financial intelligence to simply survive. The\nidea that it takes money to make money is the thinking of financially unsophisticated people. It\ndoes not mean that they're not intelligent. They have simply not learned the science of making\nmoney.\n  \nMoney is only an idea. If you want more money simply change your thinking. Every self-made\nperson started small with an idea, then turned it into something big. The same applies with\ninvesting. It takes only a few dollars to start and grow it into something big. I meet so many\npeople who spend their lives chasing the big deal, or trying to mass a lot of money to get into a\nbig deal, but to me that is foolish. Too often I have seen unsophisticated investors put their large\nnest egg into one deal and lose most of it rapidly. They may have been good workers but they\nwere not good investors.\n  \nEducation and wisdom about money are important. Start early. Buy a book. Go to a seminar.\nPractice. Start small. I turned $5,000 cash into a $1 million dollar asset producing $5,000 a\nmonth cash flow in less than six years. But I started learning as a kid. I encourage you to learn\nbecause it's not that hard. In fact, it's kind of easy once you get the hang of it.\n  \nI think I have made my message clear. It's what is in your head that determines what is in your\nhands. Money is only an idea. There is a great book called Think and Grow Rich. The title is not\nWork Hard and Grow Rich. Learn to have money work hard for you and your life will be easier\nand happier. Today, don't play it safe, play it smart.\n  \nTake Action!\n  \nMany of you were given two great gifts: your mind and your time. It is up to you to do what you\nplease with both. With each dollar bill that enters your hand, you and only you have the power\nto determine your destiny. Spend it foolishly, you choose to be poor. Spend it on liabilities, you\njoin the middle class. Invest it in your mind and learn how to acquire assets and you will be\nchoosing wealth as your goal and your future.

Kiyosaki\nRobert Kiyosaki, Sharon Lechter\n  \nAbout the Authors-Robert T. Kiyosaki\n  \n\u201cThe main reason people struggle financially is because they spent years in school but learned\nnothing about money. The result is, people learn to work for money... but never learn to have\nmoney work for them.\u201d says Robert.\n  \nBorn and raised in Hawaii, Robert is fourth-generation Japanese American. He comes from a\nprominent family of educators. His father was the head of education for the State of Hawaii.\n\"After high school, Robert was educated in New York and upon graduation, he joined the U. S.\nMarine Corps and went to Vietnam as an officer and a helicopter gunship pilot.\n  \nReturning from the war, Robert's business career began. In 1977 he founded a company that\nbrought to the market the first nylon and Velcro \u201csurfer\u201d wallets, which grew into a multi-million\ndollar worldwide product. He and his products were featured in Runner's World, Gentleman's\nQuarterly, Success Magazine, Newsweek, and even Playboy.\n  \nLeaving the business world, he co-founded in 1985, an international education company that\noperated in seven countries, teaching business and investing to tens of thousands of graduates.\n  \nRetiring at age 47, Robert does what he enjoys most... investing. Concerned about the growing\ngap between the haves and have nots, Robert created the board game CASHFLOW, which\nteaches the game of money, here before only known by the rich.\n  \nAlthough Robert's business is real estate and developing small cap companies, his true love and\npassion is teaching. He has shared the speaking stage with such greats as Og Mandino, Zig\nZiglar, and Anthony Robbins. Robert Kiyosaki's message is clear. \u201cTake responsibility for your\nfinances or take orders all your life. You're either a master of money or a slave to it.\u201d Robert\nholds classes that last from 1 hour to 3 days teaching people about the secrets of the rich.\nAlthough his subjects run from investing for high returns and low risk; to teaching your children\nto be rich; to starting companies and selling them; he has one solid earth shaking message. And\nthat message is, Awaken The Financial Genius that lies within you. Your genius is waiting to\ncome out.\n  \nThis is what world famous speaker and author Anthony Robbins says about Robert's work.\n  \n\u201cRobert Kiyosaki's work in education is powerful, profound, and life changing. I salute his efforts\nand recommend him highly.\u201d During this time of great economic change, Robert's message is\npriceless.\n  \nAbout the Authors-Sharon L. Lechter\n  \nWife and mother of three, CPA, consultant to the toy and publishing industries and business\nowner, Sharon Lechter has dedicated her professional efforts to the field of education.\n  \nShe graduated with honors from Florida State University with a degree in accounting.

Kiyosaki\n \nEPILOGUE\n  How To Pay for a Child's College Education for $7000\n  \nAs the book draws to a close and approaches publication, I would like to share a final thought\nwith you. The main reason I wrote this book was to share insights into how increased financial\nintelligence can be used to solve many of life's common problems. Without financial training, we\nall too often use the standard formulas to get through life, such as to work hard, save, borrow\nand pay excessive taxes. Today we need better information.\n  \nI use the following story as a final example of a financial problem that confronts many young\nfamilies today. How do you afford a good education for your children and provide for your own\nretirement? It is an example of using financial intelligence instead of hard work to achieve the\nsame goal.\n  \nA friend of mine was griping one day about how hard it was to save money for his four\nchildren's college education. He was putting $300 away in a mutual fund each month and had\nso far accumulated about $12,000. He estimated he needed $400,000 to get four children\nthrough college. He had 12 years to save for it, since his oldest child was then 6 years of age.\n  \nThe year was 1991, and the real estate market in Phoenix was terrible. People were giving\nhouses away. I suggested to my classmate that he buy a house with some of the money in his\nmutual fund. The idea intrigued him and we began to discuss the possibility. His primary concern\nwas that he did not have the credit with the bank to buy another house, since he was so over-\nextended. I assured him that there were other ways to finance a property other than through\nthe bank.\n  \nWe looked for a house for two weeks, a house that would fit all the criteria we were looking for.\nThere were a lot to choose from, so the shopping was kind of fun. Finally, we found a 3\nbedroom 2 bath home in a prime neighborhood. The owner had been downsized and needed to\nsell that day because he and his family were moving to California where another job waited.\n  \nHe wanted $102,000, but we offered only $79,000. He took it immediately. The home had on\nit what is called a non-qualifying loan, which means even a bum without a job could buy it\nwithout a banker's approval. The owner owed $72,000 so all my friend had to come up with\nwas $7,000, the difference in price between what was owed and what it sold for. As soon as the\nowner moved, my friend put the house up for rent. After all expenses were paid, including the\nmortgage, he put about $125 in his pocket each month.\n  \nHis plan was to keep the house for 12 years and let the mortgage get paid down faster, by\napplying the extra $125 to the principle each month. We figured that in 12 years, a large\nportion of the mortgage would be paid off and he could possibly be clearing $800 a month by\nthe time his first child went to college. He could also sell the house if it had appreciated in value.\n  \nIn 1994, the real estate market suddenly changed in Phoenix and he was offered $156,000 for\nthe same house by the tenant who lived in it and loved it. Again, he asked me what I thought,\nPage 111/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3171, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "518e5872-4a92-41b9-a370-a326076666f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "518e5872-4a92-41b9-a370-a326076666f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "112", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5f9e3d30-3c1c-4e28-ae55-53fa5f73d9bd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "112", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "696a73b8aca57d94435a32c234bd766bbeff722e9594986b66fad07f82a96ad2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1ab2b2b5-a961-411b-a17d-5836434eda82", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "111", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "c1d5865af67b89c1f97d40aec169fbb74747125271edf2d9b341e6dd2092cc98", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "592482c7-a1f5-40fe-b0aa-7787acc8dcd1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "72b6d749f10d73177296175b6ab3c82d7a90fb767f553d5d73a06460a874b98c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "4c878a05bc51cfeb976e767e0a3218bae2dc8b3214b165e8da412b8ecbe520bd", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T.

I called another friend in Austin, Texas who\nthen moved this tax deferred money into a mini-storage facility. Within three months, he began\nreceiving checks for a little less than a $1,000 a month in income which he then poured back\ninto the college mutual fund that was now building much faster. In 1996, the mini-warehouse\nsold and he received a check for nearly $330,000 as proceeds from the sale which was again\nrolled into a new project that would now throw off over $3,000 a month in income, again,\ngoing into the college mutual fund. He is now very confident that his goal of $400,000 will be\nmet easily, and it only took $7,000 to start and a little financial intelligence. His children will be\nable to afford the education that they want and he will then use the underlying asset, wrapped in\nhis C Corporation, to pay for his retirement. As a result of this successful investment strategy he\nwill be able to retire early.\n  \nThank you for reading this book. I hope it has provided some insights into utilizing the power of\nmoney to work for you. Today, we need greater financial intelligence to simply survive. The\nidea that it takes money to make money is the thinking of financially unsophisticated people. It\ndoes not mean that they're not intelligent. They have simply not learned the science of making\nmoney.\n  \nMoney is only an idea. If you want more money simply change your thinking. Every self-made\nperson started small with an idea, then turned it into something big. The same applies with\ninvesting. It takes only a few dollars to start and grow it into something big. I meet so many\npeople who spend their lives chasing the big deal, or trying to mass a lot of money to get into a\nbig deal, but to me that is foolish. Too often I have seen unsophisticated investors put their large\nnest egg into one deal and lose most of it rapidly. They may have been good workers but they\nwere not good investors.\n  \nEducation and wisdom about money are important. Start early. Buy a book. Go to a seminar.\nPractice. Start small. I turned $5,000 cash into a $1 million dollar asset producing $5,000 a\nmonth cash flow in less than six years. But I started learning as a kid. I encourage you to learn\nbecause it's not that hard. In fact, it's kind of easy once you get the hang of it.\n  \nI think I have made my message clear. It's what is in your head that determines what is in your\nhands. Money is only an idea. There is a great book called Think and Grow Rich. The title is not\nWork Hard and Grow Rich. Learn to have money work hard for you and your life will be easier\nand happier. Today, don't play it safe, play it smart.\n  \nTake Action!\n  \nMany of you were given two great gifts: your mind and your time. It is up to you to do what you\nplease with both. With each dollar bill that enters your hand, you and only you have the power\nto determine your destiny. Spend it foolishly, you choose to be poor. Spend it on liabilities, you\njoin the middle class. Invest it in your mind and learn how to acquire assets and you will be\nchoosing wealth as your goal and your future.

Kiyosaki\n  \nYou and your children's future will be determined by choices you make today, not tomorrow.\n  \nWe wish you great wealth and much happiness with this fabulous gift called life.\n  \nRobert Kiyosaki, Sharon Lechter\n  \nAbout the Authors-Robert T. Kiyosaki\n  \n\u201cThe main reason people struggle financially is because they spent years in school but learned\nnothing about money. The result is, people learn to work for money... but never learn to have\nmoney work for them.\u201d says Robert.\n  \nBorn and raised in Hawaii, Robert is fourth-generation Japanese American. He comes from a\nprominent family of educators. His father was the head of education for the State of Hawaii.\n\"After high school, Robert was educated in New York and upon graduation, he joined the U. S.\nMarine Corps and went to Vietnam as an officer and a helicopter gunship pilot.\n  \nReturning from the war, Robert's business career began. In 1977 he founded a company that\nbrought to the market the first nylon and Velcro \u201csurfer\u201d wallets, which grew into a multi-million\ndollar worldwide product. He and his products were featured in Runner's World, Gentleman's\nQuarterly, Success Magazine, Newsweek, and even Playboy.\n  \nLeaving the business world, he co-founded in 1985, an international education company that\noperated in seven countries, teaching business and investing to tens of thousands of graduates.\n  \nRetiring at age 47, Robert does what he enjoys most... investing. Concerned about the growing\ngap between the haves and have nots, Robert created the board game CASHFLOW, which\nteaches the game of money, here before only known by the rich.\n  \nAlthough Robert's business is real estate and developing small cap companies, his true love and\npassion is teaching. He has shared the speaking stage with such greats as Og Mandino, Zig\nZiglar, and Anthony Robbins. Robert Kiyosaki's message is clear. \u201cTake responsibility for your\nfinances or take orders all your life. You're either a master of money or a slave to it.\u201d Robert\nholds classes that last from 1 hour to 3 days teaching people about the secrets of the rich.\nAlthough his subjects run from investing for high returns and low risk; to teaching your children\nto be rich; to starting companies and selling them; he has one solid earth shaking message. And\nthat message is, Awaken The Financial Genius that lies within you. Your genius is waiting to\ncome out.\n  \nThis is what world famous speaker and author Anthony Robbins says about Robert's work.\n  \n\u201cRobert Kiyosaki's work in education is powerful, profound, and life changing. I salute his efforts\nand recommend him highly.\u201d During this time of great economic change, Robert's message is\npriceless.\n  \nAbout the Authors-Sharon L. Lechter\n  \nWife and mother of three, CPA, consultant to the toy and publishing industries and business\nowner, Sharon Lechter has dedicated her professional efforts to the field of education.\n  \nPage 113/114 http://motsach.info", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2970, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d259ac77-7059-4540-b645-c939036091fe": {"__data__": {"id_": "d259ac77-7059-4540-b645-c939036091fe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "114", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "badd5ce9-c645-4350-b3fb-1f235cbdb08b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "114", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "7a0b7b7f9d65286913c4179f75500a4ae5e57a08eb3fa2818efd78649e20e797", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "592482c7-a1f5-40fe-b0aa-7787acc8dcd1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "113", "file_name": "rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_path": "data/rich_dad_poor_dad.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 515825, "creation_date": "2024-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "72b6d749f10d73177296175b6ab3c82d7a90fb767f553d5d73a06460a874b98c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "4bf03af92ac6f6d2a0c44ac1228147c65f6800aee99c430897bf18e1170bf998", "text": "Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert T.

It was a\nstruggle to get them to read. They would rather watch TV.\n  \nSo she was delighted to join forces with the inventor of the first electronic \u201ctalking book\u201d and\nhelp expand the electronic book industry to a multi-million dollar international market. Today,\nshe remains a pioneer in developing new technologies to bring the book back into\n  \nchildren's lives.\n  \nAs her own children grew, she was keenly involved in their education. She became a vocal\nactivist in the areas of mathematics, computers, reading and writing education.\n  \n\u201cOur current educational system has not been able to keep pace with the global and\ntechnological changes in the world today. We must teach our young people the skills, both\nscholastic and financial, that they will need not only to survive, but to flourish, in the world they\nface.\u201d\n  \nAs co-author of Rich Dad Poor
